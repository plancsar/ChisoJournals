<pb><p align=center>=== WINTER COMES TO DEVOKAN ===

<p align=left>=== Dot's journal, 9 Nov 2009 ===
People have started keeping diaries of their time in Devokan -- just as well I bought a job lot of generic blank journals. Some are leaving their diaries out for others to read; others are keeping them as a personal record.

I woke up on Saturday to an amazing sight: the first snow of winter had fallen overnight. The trees and bushes had already been showing signs that winter was approaching, with their bare branches silhouetted against the sky, and there has been a definite chill in the air for some time, so the snow was no surprise.

While Paislee and I were talking things over yesterday, someone named AeGleh greeted us with "Shorah!" It seems that AeGleh stumbled across the GoMa site while looking for a clue to a mystery in Gahreesen (one of Andy's posts turned up in the search). Having seen the various posts about the community in this world, he decided to visit us.

We had a great time. I took him across to my office at the top of the Keep, and showed him round the building. We used the village lift/elevator to get back to the main island, and then we went on an aerial tour of the village on my mini-airship, picking up Paislee and Mat on the way.

We finished by flying up to Selenitica. This took some time, but the little airship did well, coping even with turbulent air pockets.

Quin's ship was docked there, but there was no sign of Quin even though we shouted for him. Paislee suspected he might be engrossed in tinkering with machinery somewhere.


=== Paislee's journal, 12 Nov 2009 === 
This morning I awoke to a first fall of early snow. Good thing that I felt the chill winds coming off the sea last night and shut all the doors to the inn. Our supply of firewood is limited on the island.

Gazing at the white blanket of snow from my window I'm reminded of winter's past while Quin's elderly aunt was still alive in her hilltop house. Days of trudging up the hill, soup pot snuggled in towels to protect against the cold, I'd climb up to her door. She was always so kind to me during my childhood. I was pleased to visit with her each day and tend to her needs.

When she lost her struggle with the influenza we placed her in her final resting place by the lynch gate leading to the chapel on the hill. She desired no epitaph, no remembrance, no ceremony... Private in life and private in death.

Her life before residing in our village was shrouded in mystery... so very like the life of her nephew Quin who arrived some months after her passing.

I wonder...


=== Paislee's journal, 13 Nov 2009 ===
Dot and I had a lovely cup of tea this evening. I chanced upon her in the fir trees and we struck up a conversation. As dusk arrived the air took on a bitter chill so I invited her for a cup of tea in my attic rooms.

Pepper, as usual, slept through the whole visit... silly cat! But Dot and I chatted and warmed outselves with some tea and biscuits. I'm afraid we ate them all.

It was a pleasant way to end a full day of chores here at the Inn. Now to stoke up the fires one last time for the night and then...to off to bed I will be.


=== Quin's journal, 14 Nov 2009 ===
So that was what the noise was the other day: Dot and others shouting; I had wondered what it was. However, at the time I was attempting to repair a somewhat complicated mechanism, a task calling for the utmost concentration. Some of the parts were particularly small and delicate.

Be that as it may. I have now completed this first stage of work in Selenitica. The walkways are stable and safe, and enable straightforward access to the main monitoring points in the area.

For the time being, I have decided not to replace the machinery in the main control building in the centre of the complex. I have no desire to have my work on it so far inadvertently destroyed by curious explorers insisting on touching every button and pulling on every lever to 'see what happens'. I can tell you what will happen: the machine will lock up, twisting and cracking the internal mechanics.

I have therefore returned to the village to perform chemical analyses on the minerals found in Selenitica.


=== Nalates' journal, 16 Nov 2009 ===
I've just returned from a week in combat, psych warfare... exhausting.

I find the weather here cold and refreshing. The sunlight is wonderful. I did not realize how much I miss the swan or how much the sphere worries me. I keep glancing up at it. Not knowing if it is friend or foe keeps me on edge. I have yet to see any one near it.

Trying to find a way to the sphere I've started using more links. I have found my way to other areas as well as the upper level of the library. A cat was there playing with a book fallen on the floor. I had the eerie feeling it was reading it... now I'm wondering if it is some shape shifter... maybe a creature that just looks like a cat... or maybe it is just a cat. I'm spooking myself.

The residents... no one is around. That makes me more nervous. There is a small vehicle of some type parked in the village center. In Paislee's setting room in the Inn there was a steaming teapot. Many of the Inn's doors were open. Letting the heat out... I wouldn't normally mind but I fell from the bridge today. Got soaked and had to dry out. I fell being silly. I got over-confident of my abilities... combat training tends to make us cocky. I won't be trying to walk on the bridge as it goes up and down again. It sticks and jerks unpredictably, which caused me to slip.

Searching the Inn I found no one. The kitchen had food out, meat roasting... not burnt. Someone was there not long before me.

I moved on to the Keep. I could not find any new information. I did however meet Quinquifid Oddenfen. A nice young-looking man, handsome. After talking with him and his repeated assurances Devokan is a hidden refuge and safe I feel much better. More importantly the sphere is an experiment of some kind made by friends of his... has something to do with lost pages. It's not a military thing as I feared.

Quin tells me Dot, the woman I know, is traveling to other worlds. I hope none are the ones I fight in. I fear she would be terrified. Paislee, I do not know her well, has gone after supplies. I guess it might not be safe to have just anyone bringing supplies here.

It is so wonderful to finally completely relax. I think I'll catch some sleep at the Inn... 


=== Dot's journal, 20 Nov 2009 ===
I've been talking with Quin about borrowing the Devokan Flyer for an extended period. I'm wanting to check something out.

He kindly agreed, saying that the nexus link to Selenitica was working well, and that he would be concentrating on analysing the crystals he collected from there over the next few weeks.

So I'll be packing up over the weekend and heading off. This is going to be interesting.


=== Nalates' journal, 20 Nov 2009 === 
I met Quin again. Nice guy. He answered many questions for me. I'm much more comfortable in Devokan now. I was worried that the sphere eclipsing the sun was some type of military installation. That thinking is a holdover from service as a soldier in several wars. Oh well...

I'm currently involved in a psychological war effort to break a propaganda war and hopefully move several worlds and factions closer to a peace accord. I'll be working in one of the space stations where I have high-level military access.

That will reduce my time in Devokan. I miss Devokan when away.

The swan came back for a few days. I was worried about it. The little lake we like is unlikely to freeze unless Devokan gets much much colder because of the spring feeding it. But I don't know if there will be enough food for the swan. I had to decide if feeding it would help or hurt. With my commitments in other places drawing me away, I decided I should not create a dependence. Now it seems to have decided migrating was best. I'm relieved even though I miss it.


=== Paislee's journal, 24 Nov 2009 === 
A music box arrived today on the doorstep of the inn. A small note written in spidery lettering was attached. "For my dear Elspeth"

It took a bit of doing, but I managed to load a spare stone bench onto a sled and pull it to her grave marker. I didn't want to set the carousel in the snow so onto the bench it went, waiting for a friendly touch.

Listening to the cheerful tunes I remembered the good times we had up in her crooked house on the hill when she was new to the island and full of energy and good health. Tales of happy times and adventure and far away places.

I miss her, and it appears someone else does as well. I asked Quin who the giver of the gift might be, but he is as puzzled as I.


=== Dot's journal, 25 Nov 2009 ===
When going away, why does it always take twice as long to pack up things than you had originally planned? I finally managed to leave Devokan yesterday, and I'm now on my way.

I'll try to keep in touch with events on the island. Quinquifid has promised to keep track of things and post regular reports, though he does seem to be a little preoccupied with his experiments on the Selenitica crystals.

Paislee had complained earlier of acrid smells wafting down the hillside and into the inn, so Quin has moved the experiments out of his house and into the Lighthouse. This is an improvement -- the offshore breeze carries the fumes out over the ocean.

I'm not sure what he hopes to achieve with these experiments, but still -- it keeps him out of mischief. 


<pb>=== Quin's journal, 27 Nov 2009 ===
My experiments on the crystals are going well. Both their chemical and physical properties are worth studying.

Some crystals emit random sequences of sounds, each with a different periodicity. I wonder whether this randomness could be harnessed in a useful way.

I am beginning to be concerned about the island next to Devokan. There seems to be some instability developing there -- it is minor at present, but given this region's history this will require careful monitoring. I have placed a geostable device on the windmill island; hopefully that will give us adequate warning of major problems.

Dot has sent a short note: she has safely arrived at her intended destination and is proceeding to the next stage of the planned exploration.


=== Note on village noticeboard ===
Something strange is happening here. We're not sure exactly what is behind all this, and would appreciate help in observing and speculating.

Various explorers and villagers are keeping diary journals; these may be found on the main island.

If you have any ideas or further observations to add, please contact me. Thank you.

<pb><p align=center>=== THE STRANGE SPHERES ===

<p align=left>=== Paislee's journal, 27 Nov 2009 === 
After reading Quin's notice on the public message board I took a quick boat ride over to Discover, the island to the north. Despite the chill and fog the journey was invigorating.

Alas, upon my arrival I saw that something was indeed amiss! A strange sphere is hovering over a section of plank boardwalk. As I drew closer I could hear strange noises emaniating from it...

Quin must be informed of this new development. I am afraid of what this means for our neighbors to the north!


=== Holli's journal, 27 Nov 2009 === 
Met up with Paislee today, and she mentioned a "peculiarity" in the area by the island.

Happened upon her and Mat again a bit later when I went to investigate. From what I overheard of their conversation, the anomaly has expanded quite a bit from the time it was initially noticed, and theoretically, may continue to do so. The anomaly itself appears as a large sphere, currently about three and a half times my height, with a swirled, slightly iridescent-seeming surface. Being the sort of person I am, I had to take a chance and try something. As of yet, I've suffered no adverse effects from passing through the sphere. Some disorientation, but nothing other than that. The surface of the Sphere does not prevent passage through it. I've made some sketches and plan to come back with a camera sometime in the next few days. Forgot it today. Hopefully, it can be contained or will cause no lasting damage.

Obviously, I'm feeling a bit better, if I'm doing this sort of thing. Still need to bother Quin about taking a look at those crystals he brought back. He seems rather busy/preoccupied, though. Wouldn't want to be a nuisance. And since I know you may see this, Quin, consider this me asking.


=== Reemi's report, 28 Nov 2009 ===
Yesterday, I finally was granted the wonderful opportunity to explore Devokan and my, what a beautiful and wonderful place. It's full of so many sights to see! Instantly I was enveloped by a sense of peace knowing that I was among fellow friends. I met Quin, Paislee, Mat and many other kind and exciting people.

I took a look at Quin's experiments with the crystals. The noises they emit are quite interesting. If I recall right, Quin said there was a pattern to the breaks between noises. Outside there was a furnace of some sorts, warming some vials and slowly rotating them. The vials contained crystals dissolved in acid, hence the fumes.

Hearing about the instabilities in the island, I was instantly curious to see it. Quin was happy to give me a ride in his handy hovercraft/submarine vehicle and so we ventured off to the island with little turbulence. The wonderful surprise waiting for us there was the sphere phenomenon that Holli described. The sphere gave me an odd feeling of foreboding, but one shouldn't always listen to intuition, no? My breath caught as we drove into it cautiously. Nothing happened. There was absolutely no resistance to our entry.

Later that day, in the evening, we ventured to check on the sphere once again and take some notes. I'll post the findings that I can recall and feel free to correct me if I mix something up...

Upon close inspection there is two spheres, one inside of the other, both rotating slowly. The size of both spheres were rather close, and so difficult to notice. Their surface was as Holli noted, swirled, slightly iridescent-seeming, and semitransparent. Blue and greens flitted across its surface along with the occasional tinge of purple.

Inside the larger sphere, was the ghost of another sphere featuring flecks of translucent white. Being inside the sphere had no effects other than being unable to see much outside and finding yourself a bit dazed. Portals made inside the sphere can be seen. In the afternoon the sphere emitted some sort of odd, constant hum. Later in the evening, no hum could be heard but upon standing outside the sphere another faint noise was heard. Inside the sphere the noise grew louder and more distinct and can only be described (I'm no good at describing sounds, someone else please give this a try) as, to put it bluntly, "creepy". The sounds were fitting to a lonely, disturbing moment in the Myst Series or perhaps a lonely planet amidst the stars...?

Paislee noticed that it has grown since she saw it in the morning and that worries me. If it's growing then what ill effects with the islands suffer? We speculated on the sphere being an instability in the fabric of space. I dearly hope that is not the case. Could it be something related to what happened to Riven? Will it break apart, then collaspe? This is where the relationship between the island and Devokan comes in. Quin said that Paislee thought the islands were not a part of Devokan, but somehow they are linked. Let's hope this link isn't strong enough to affect Devokan if the island was to be harmed. I've grown quite fond of Devokan.

The energy maintaining the sphere's shape and creating the light appear to be very strong and stable, but it still allows one to leisurely stroll through? The sphere reminds me of the Bubbles in Myst: End of Ages but the sphere maintains its shape much better...they both allowed people to walk into them easily though...


=== Holli's journal, 29 Nov 2009 === 
Talked to Quin and Paislee a bit... Yesterday, I think. My sleep schedule or lack thereof is throwing of my sense of time. Anyway, we talked for a while, though conversation turned to Quin's late aunt. I'm afraid I clammed up due to not knowing anything of the woman or her situation. Need to learn to be less awkward. Also, being anti-social is getting old. Work on that!

Met up with Reemi today. She seems nice enough, and we went to inspect the new developments in the anomaly. It's much, much smaller that it was previously. Interesting as well was the gazebo-like structure that has appeared on the northern part of the main island. It is slightly small, with three benches apparently made of some sort of stone. The rounded sides appear to be made of the same substances as the sphere, with similar qualities and even similar crystalline sounds. I'd been thinking all day, wondering what the sound reminded me of. Crystals. Not quite the ones Quin has, but crystals in general. Not that that's likely to make much sense.

The roof of the pavilion depicts men on horseback, many bearing spears. Is this a clue to the true nature of the pavilion or where it came from? Only time will tell, hopefully. I admit to wanting to know more. Perhaps I might be able to reach the roof of the pavilion somehow to collect samples of the paint. Seeing what created the pigments might be interesting and enlightening.

I present the theory that the lessening in surface area of the sphere is directly related to the appearance of the pavilion. Matter cannot just be created from nothing. I believe that the lessening of the sphere is caused by this principle. No, as to how it happened and why, I'll leave that to others to guess. Unless I find something myself, that is. The best of what I find is often on my own... It's a bit lonesome, though.

No matter. I'll continue my nosing about, and if I foind something, I'll be sure to say something to someone. No need to be an outsider all the time...


=== Quin's journal, 29 Nov 2009 === 
There seems to be a fresh development today. I caught up with Miss Paislee between her chores (she was about to make some potato soup -- very warming and filling, just what is needed in this chilly winter weather).

The sphere over the walkway has shrunk a little, she feels. However, a strange ancient-looking pavilion with sides of similar material to the sphere (if 'material' is the correct word) has appeared among the trees to the north of the village.

We spent a few minutes sitting in the pavilion, listening to the aetherial but somewhat unsettling 'music'(?) that fills its interior.

Reemi mentioned in her report 'an odd feeling of foreboding'. I would agree. Something is not quite right here. 


=== Holli's journal, 30 Nov 2009 === 
Dug my camera out and brought it with me today... It's pretty in its own way, at least.

Makes me uneasy as heek, though...

Got a shot of the pavilion, but I need to check something first.


=== Nalates' journal, 30 Nov 2009 === 
Today I saw the notes in the village on the sphere. Alarming. I went to see it. It is much like the dimensional rifts I've seen on the battlefields. Except those are usually belching out enemy troops, laser beams or chemical gases... plus they are controlled and never stand still... This may be natural phenomena. I didn't bring my battle gear, so I couldn't do a complete scan for control fields. My small unit shows no controls. That's not absolutely certain but at least if there are any controls it's not by an enemy I know... and that is a long list.

I found Quin's monitor. It is technology I've never seen. It looks old and strange. I have no idea what the gauge readings mean. I decided not to expose it to my scanner. I figure Quin knows what he is doing. I also did not leave any of my surveillance equipment. I don't know how that would react to Quin's equipment. I took pictures. I can take more later and let the computer compare them. For now there is nothing more I can do.

I made a sweep of the village. I found a music box merry-go-round thingy by the grave. I guessed someone was missing a friend. I wish them peace.

I saw my first Christmas tree in the village today. Someone is in the spirit.

The snow is getting deeper. I closed several doors today. I need to bring back some door closers to mount on them.

Heavens, the lighthouse has a horrid smell. Quin's experiments... maybe when he finishes I can take them back with me and sell them for use in chemical warfare... pppeeeeww!

The crystals do sing... or chirp is more like it. I may bring a computer back to analyze the sounds and search for patterns... math relationships... something.

There is a new critter hanging out with me. I remember one like it from one of the D'ni worlds. This one is much smaller. Today she was eating a little red something... have no idea where she found that. Maybe if I can find more I can make friends. It does not seem to mind the snow.

I looked for more of the little creatures. I only saw the one. I hope she is not alone.


=== Dot's journal, 5 Dec 2009 === 
I'm back home. Although tiring, the expedition was successful. The fruits from it will probably be vital in the weeks to come, especially in the light of what is happening at the moment in Devokan and its environs.

I'm very grateful to Holli and Reemi for monitoring and reporting developments, and to Quin for his continuing experiments on the crystals.

I spoke to Holli earlier today, who has recruited a friend to help with observing developments. We discussed keeping a daily photographic record of the strange sphere, and maybe displaying it on an imager in my office in the keep. In the meantime, she and her friend will both keep a written record of their observations in their diary journals.


=== Reemi's journal, 5 Dec 2009 === 
Today Paislee, Dot and I went to go see the sphere. It doesn't appear to have grown since Wednesday, which may have lifted my spirits in the slightest if it wasn't for another unpleasant surprise that sprang up. Farther along the walkway is a very faint shadow of the sphere, quite difficult to see. It is small, I'd say more than a person high. Is it the beginning of ANOTHER sphere?! Very worrying...

Eventually we got chilled and went back to Devokan for some tea to soothe our nerves. I ended up spilling tea all over myself and had to run to the nearest restroom which was all the way to the Keep! Perhaps more washrooms ought to be installed...? 

I wonder what the meaning of this all is? The spheres and gazebo are related. The gazebo sounds like the white crystals, which suggests maybe they are related. Everything is all guesswork! Very irritating. For now I'll busy myself with monitoring the phenomena. I hate being pessimistic, but the whole situation gives me a very bad feeling...


=== Nalates' journal, 9 Dec 2009 === 
I've missed Devokan. But I had little time in Devokan this trip. Starting a new offensive campaign always seems to take longer than is planned...

The little Squee is still here. I'm happy to see her. She has a friend! So, there are more of them. I'll have to look to see if there is fruit at the Inn.

Walking north to check on the sphere I stopped to read the message board. OMG! Now there are two spheres! This can't be good. Paislee is worried by the tone of her note.

As I continued north I came upon a deer. She was nibbling on a tree. She seemed unalarmed having me crunching through the snow. She watched me and I was careful not to startle her.

There are two spheres. Not that big. I took more pictures and will have the computer compare them. Quin's monitoring station is still there so I'll stay with my decision not to use any of my sensors. On my next trip I need to bring more equipment back with me.


<pb><p align=center> === TRACING THE SOURCE === 

<p align=left>=== Dot's journal, 10 Dec 2009 ===
When I linked to Devokan today, Paislee sent an urgent message to join her to see what has happened.

It seems that overnight the spheres have coalesced. There is now a single sphere, but far larger than before -- about 25 m in diameter -- and having a more complex structure. It has also developed a solid core, large enough to stand on.

The sphere itself has moved so that the gaseous envelope engulfs one of the upper walkways. It is still possible to use the walkway, but walking through the swirling lights is quite disorientating and your vision blurs as you enter the sphere.


=== Note from Holli, 11 Dec 2009 === 
What the frikking frik?! Linked in to where I've been taking the pictures from and the thing was right in my face! I sort of ended up falling off of the walkway and into the water. 

Uhm... I need to send you those pictures, sorry, Dot. I've been taking them, though. Only missed one day since we talked, and that was due to technical difficulties... 

There are copies in my journal, though.


=== Reply from Dot, 11 Dec 2009 ===
Great! Thanks, Holli. Perhaps we can meet up sometime over the weekend.

I'd like to set up some sort of time-lapse display in my office so that we can view how the thing has evolved and perhaps predict its future.

Though I have to admit that this latest development took me by surprise.


=== Quin's journal, 15 Dec 2009 ===
I have a further development to report: the gazebo walls have changed. It seems they are some kind of imager, and are now displaying a wild-looking, remote island. I certainly don't recognise the place.

When I was discussing this with Dot, she said that it reminded her a little of some strangely fluidic imager 'bubbles' she had previously encountered which enclosed a method of linking to other ages/worlds.


=== Holli's journal, 19 Dec 2009 ===
Got sick yet again and missed another day... Sorry. Should be back up to speed soon. Still been unable to give Artair his journal, unfortunately. We've talked some, though. He seems to think that the sphere might have some sort of sentience. Not sure what to make of that, really.

Also, I've been seeing what seem to be smaller spheres, more the size of the main one's core flitting about on that area. I haven't been able to catch any on film, though. I've certainly been trying, but they're fast and they seem to disappear again rather quickly.

The core of the main sphere is solid enough to sit and stand on if you're willing to make the jump from the walkway. It rotates and also creates a sound that is rather invasive and resembles that of running water or rain falling.

As to the pavilion, the sides have indeed changed to some sort of island, and it's put me in mind of the "bubbles" Someone else has mentioned. Dot, I think it was. I'd actually mentioned that idea to Artair some time before the change occurred, funnily enough. He didn't really know what I meant, I think, but there it was. Also, some of the Selenetica crystals ave appeared in close proximity to the pavilion, as well as a beeping sound. Did Quin put them there? I haven't spoken with him recently, so it is a possibility.

More things to think on. Maybe I'll be better able to do so with some sleep.

=== Quin's journal, 25 Dec 2009 === 
The first stage of my experiment is complete.

I've moved the crystals by the gazebo. Now we wait... 


=== Nalates' journal, 27 Dec 2009 === 
Seems there is always massive waiting in any military effort. So, while waiting around I've had time to make a more complete analysis of my last set of readings on the spheres. I have also had time to compare them to reams of readings taken to detect the portals used by our enemies to send the green insect-like creatures into the battlefields.

The control fields are very different from those I've seen in combat. So, while I may know what is going to happen I can't be overly precise as to when... or exactly what the changes will be. From all I have seen it appears the entire forest area around the sphere will be sucked through the portal. The area is likely to be moved to another dimension, time or world. Removals are often, but not always, followed by a replacement... who knows what that might be.

Not knowing who is controlling this means I have no clue what may be coming, if anything. I'm guessing. May be some eccentric just likes the looks of the place and is stealing it. Whatever the case, the energy build up rate gives us a about a month... may be two to six weeks... then the forest will likely be gone. That is a sad thought.

If it is being stolen, I want to know by who and where it is being taken. I found that the energy flow is traceable and has a destination. I took a chance on one of my rest periods and teleported there. No doubt the forest is being moved. I have some pictures. More alarming is parts of Selenitica are being moved. I have to wonder if the crystals can be used in place of the more obvious portal spheres.

I thought of destroying the crystals in Devokan... I decided to leave Quin a note and see what he thinks after seeing the pictures.


=== Quin's journal, 27 Dec 2009 ===
I am pleased to report some success with my experimental placement of the crystals around the strange gazebo. By tuning their frequencies I have been able to acquire a closer view of the island reported by Miss Holli above.

The image shows rough hewn stone steps wending and winding up a pathway lined with boulders, towards an ancient-looking archway. Could this be some sort of ceremonial route for processions? Blazing fire torches line the path, suggesting that the island is inhabited -- unless of course there is some sort of time displacement going on.

Having checked on the crystal experiment, I went on to check my monitoring device on the neighbouring island. Passing by the sphere, I noticed a change in the central core: it looks as though it is splitting into two, rather as the nucleus of an amoeba might do in reproduction. An interesting development.

However, the results from the monitoring device are rather disturbing. As I returned to the Lighthouse, musing on what I had seen, I chanced upon the warrior woman I had met previously: Nalates Urriah. Being between campaigns, she had visited Devokan for a brief respite from her onerous duties.

We discussed the phenomena. She explained that she had set up some of her own monitoring devices on the island around the sphere -- she had come across similar entities before on a battlefield -- but was bemused at the differences shown by the Devokan sphere. I see that she has reported on her results above, and added some further detail. A remarkable, and very brave, woman.

For there is one extremely disturbing fact. Both her results and mine concur: the energy/activity of the sphere is increasing daily; extrapolating from my results suggests that the force may reach a critical point in the next two to three weeks, which is in the same time frame as Ms Urriah's independently run tests; and there seems to be some kind of force 'sucking' the reality of the tree village towards the sphere.

<p align=left>=== Paislee's journal, 30 Dec 2009 === 
It's been a tiring week....Since the arrival of the spheres among the trees to the north I've been worried that bad things would transpire. Others have been concerned as well.

While looking through my binoculars this morning I discovered an entire tree was missing as well as a section of walkway. I knew I should prepare for the worst outcome of these strange events.

So, I bundled up against the cold and braved the cold sea waters. After several arduous trips I managed to retrieve most of the items in the central tree hut and put them into storage. Should their owners ever return for them they will find them safe and in good condition.

Now I need a hearty bowl of soup. I just hope I am mistaken in thinking that more will disappear in the days to come...


=== Dot's journal, 1 Jan 2010 === 
Today when I checked there are four spheres, two large and two smaller.

One of the large ones is partly submerged, the flux enclosing the pump at the end of one of the lower walkways.

The other surrounds the hut with the lift, with the solid core blocking a doorway. It is quite eerie going into the hut via the other door, watching the flux through the windows, the windchimes sounding as they always do.

The two smaller spheres are on the windmill island. One surrounds the hut that contains the windmill gears. The other's solid core has engulfed Quin's monitoring equipment, meaning we can't get at it any more.

There might be a pattern here. I hope Holli can get photos of all these...


=== Note from Holli, 1 Jan 2010 ===
Missed yesterday evening... for various reasons, but I got today's shot.

One thing Artair mentioned is that they now seem to be centering on anything that passes for tech or evidence of civilization in the area. As you've said in more detail, Dot. That seems to be the only connecting feature we've found to the new positioning. Anyway, working on keeping the pictures up-to-date despite things and sort of being worried about being there at the wrong moment...


=== Nalates' journal, 1 Jan 2010 === 
I saw Quin. He is concerned about the spheres... seriously concerned. He asked about my measurements and was excited by the images I captured at the other end of the energy flow. I guess my technology is as strange to him as his is to me. He seemed really surprised and excited that I had traveled there. He asked if I could help him get there.

I'll have to return home and get the gear I'll need. The small unit I use to travel has been modified to make random inter-dimensional jumps to avoid my being followed. That would certainly create problems for me transporting Quin. The usual process of sending destination coordinates back doesn't seem to work...

I've heard the techs at my duty station talking about new technology to allow easy transport between an entire new range of worlds. I think I've learned enough about it to make measurements on this trip with Quin then write directions for how to use the tech to get to the other end of the energy stream. I know the Devokians will want to know how to get to the forest village if... well... now it looks like WHEN... it gets sucked to a new dimension.

This whole sphere thing seems to have upset the peace of Devokan. The squees seem unaffected. They play and eat... the one I think is female is a little cubby... I wonder if she is pregnant? They look healthy and happy.

Well... I better get moving. Quin seemed a bit impatient. I'll write more when we get back.


=== Dot's journal, 4 Jan 2010 ===
The spheres have multiplied again. There are more on the windmill island, covering the sail mechanism as well as the pumps and Quin's monitoring station. There are more spheres among the trees -- and further disappearances of trees.

What sort of energy/force/plasma/whatever could remove whole trees, including their root systems, without leaving a trace?

And what is more important: where are Nalates and Quin?


=== Nalates' journal, 7 Jan 2010 === 
I'm rushed. News from home is grim. Just time for some memory joggers.

The HIPPO transport got us to the new lands quite easily. I think Quin was impressed. I was relieved it worked without embarrassing me. The Village Forest is materializing in a different world. There is more there than either of us expected. Some individual or group has been building and running things there. No clues as to why they wanted the forest. There are some odd buildings there. Currently much of the land is untouched.

There is a single small version of the spheres in the forest in the far world. I have lots of measurements. The energy sources that seem to power it are more like Quin's technology than mine. I must study the time shifts and tachyon emissions.

I think I can duplicate the transfer process. I have no idea what I would do with that slooowww process. No good for combat or defense, which reminds me, I need to go. ...


<pb>=== Dot's journal, 8 Jan 2010 ===
Things are happening so quickly now, it is hard to keep track of them.

I'm relieved to say that both Nalates and Quin have returned safely. Nalates posted a note on the village notice board:
---
Quin and I made the trip. We were both fascinated by the lands at the far end of the energy stream. We spent longer there than I expected. Quin had lots of measurements to make. This process is different than I've seen. I'm used to the process gulping up things almost instantaneously. This process seems to move molecule by molecule until most of the object it moved, then pop the remainder across. It gives the impression things are in two places at once.

I learned a lot and think I can program a chip to make a transporter to take Devokians between the worlds. So, we will still be able to reach the village forest.

Quin had a message about some family thing. After profuse thanks for helping with the trip he was off. He made no mention of where he was going or when he planned to return. I'm off to my world. Combat is escalating and messages are grim. I'll return as soon as I can.
-----
Quin left a terse note that he was back, then swanned off to New Babbage to see his solicitors. We need him back here!


=== Dot's journal, 9 Jan 2010 === 
Soon the tree village will disappear. Paislee and I were quietly standing there, looking across from Devokan. We were feeling strangely detached, remembering it with fondness -- as though it had already gone.

I took a photograph of the spheres glowing eerily in the night air. It was a magical moment.


=== Dot's journal, 10 Jan 2010 ===
Quinquifid has brought back some photos after visiting the source of the strange spheres in the tree village.

It seems the spheres are benign, and are translating what Quin calls the 'essence' of the tree village to this new world -- rather, new to us.

From the photos there are (or have been) people living there. The island from which the photo was taken seems to be some sort of sacred place, according to Quin.

While they were taking various readings in this other world, Nalates explained how to use the teleporting device. We're hoping to visit there ourselves over the coming week.

Throughout the weekend, the transfer across the worlds continued.

When I checked earlier today, all the huts, walkways, windmill and wildlife had gone. Just the bare trees and a few small spheres remain. Over what was the windmill island is a sphere core -- might this be the 'central control'?

Paislee reported that some of the spheres have moved up to Selenitica. Strange.

Through all of this, I have been thinking of the quote we have adopted for Devokan:

 The stronger the things we face,
 the more hope we bring with us
 to the next beginning. -- Atrus, Myst IV


=== Note from Quinquifid, 10 Jan 2010 === 
Hold on to that thought, Dot. We are all going to need it...


<pb><p align=center>=== THE EVACUATION === 

<p align=left>=== Quin's journal, 10 Jan 2010 === 
I have just returned from New Babbage. My solicitors there, besides wishing to talk about the obligations placed on me as part of my late Aunt Elspeth's will, also wanted to hand over her journals, which she had left with them for safe keeping when she moved to Devokan to spend her final years.

However, I have not had a chance to read through the journals, other than to glance at their fascinating contents. For I am still digesting the implications of what I saw when the warrior Nalates used some of the equipment provided to her to transport us both to the spheres' source.

It is amazing! The essence of the trees and structures from the area next to Devokan is being translated across to this new world! I say 'essence' because, while they are recognisable, they have subtle differences -- could it be that they are a mirror of an earlier time? I'm not sure. For one thing, the trees seem to be from an earlier evolutionary period; also the platforms and walkways are made of a far stouter timber.

There are three main islands at the spheres' source. The closest one to the tree village is more developed than the other one, and is indeed the island seen on the pavilion wall imager in Devokan (good confirmation that my crystal experiment worked so well).

Nalates is an interesting person. While we were taking different readings over in the other world, she explained some of the technology she brought with her, and what it could do. She also said a little of the current war she is engaged in. The situation sounds grim. 


=== Nalates' journal, 11 Jan 2010 ===
I wasn't prepared for the shock of finding my country destroyed when I returned to duty. I'm still hurting... mostly crying and now mostly numb.

I knew the war was escalating. Something happened sending it over the edge, nukes hit us and invaders came. By the time I returned the enemy was advancing. No place was safe. I was lucky to survive my teleport in. I had come in on our side of the battle, just barely. I fought with a rage fueled by terror. We won that skirmish. Skirmish... I find it amazing all that violence and death fits in such a small word... actually it doesn't.

At the lull we stopped to re-arm and tend to our wounded that I begin to notice my comrades giving me strange looks. When I finally made it to the showers I saw what I had become. Covered in darkening green slime that was the enemies' blood my long hair was matted and sticking to me and my face in bizarre clumps and mats. Even I couldn't tell if I was human or some new race coming through the dimensional portals. The shock of seeing a blood-drenched apparition, the staccato rip of a tactical M4 in my left hand and the air-slicing scream of the katana in my right, may have given me the edge needed to survive.

As I'm writing... I realize extent of the damage shocked me into a reactive panic and frantic determination in that first battle. It came out as a cold rage while I fought. Now grief set in. When we were about to be over run we made a tactical decision to retaliate with nukes. Resignation took over. We were losing. The planet would be ruined beyond recovery. As losing the planet set in the resignation lead to our strategic decision to obliterate the planet leaving nothing for the enemy to stand on.

The planet has been an ideal transportation hub, being in a deep dimensional well, making it easily reached with simple technology. Quin told me about something similar in his experience they called a Nexus, I guess they may be similar. The deep well also apparently made it easy for the Infernals, as we call them, to invade. Now the idea is to make the planet so hot it is too costly for the enemy to come through and follow us.

When we were planning the evacuation we learned their attacks reached farther than we ever imagined. I had considered settling in a cavern some of the old D'ni Cavern explorers were building in. I was still coldly boiling and did not want my friends in Devokan to see me in that state. Also a cavern seemed safer than open sky...

Whatever, Eder D'Uru is gone too... I stop writing every so often to cry... I never imagined...

The break helped... I'm better composed now. My face must be a mess. I've found survivors. That is good, eases the pain. All of the D'Uru people were able to evacuate and many saved most of their belongings. I assume they knew the destruction was coming. I have to find someone that know how they knew. Now the refugees are looking for new homes. I think many will remain in regions near the galaxy's core among the heavily populated regions. Still a number of the survivors are looking for less costly new worlds in which to live. We should do something to stay in touch... twice refugees now...

It seems I am one of the few survivors that have the new technology to get us to the world the village forest is being pulled into. I left a write up on the tech and my custom chips in Dot's place and another in Quin's place. I made a couple of the transporter units. When I checked tonight they were gone. They probably found them and went to explore.

I traveled back to the far forest once more to test dimensional access. It is limited, over a very shallow dimensional well and it is twisted at an odd angle. That makes it safe. It can be easily hidden if need be, in fact my teleports there often fail. At first I feared it was lost too. One has to catch things just right to make the teleport. After arriving and testing I'm certain it is safe. I'll tell the Devokians when we meet.

Now I have to find Dot, Paislee, Holli and Quin, especially Quin and Dot's note says he is off in some place called New Babbage... where is that?

From Holli's diary I can see she has been very observant and has a photographic record. She is impatient and worried having little to do. So, I want to talk with her too. May she can go with Quin and I to find whoever is running things from the other end. 

I need to explain to the Devokians how easy it was for me to find Devokan and why. I don't know how much they know about or teleport systems and dimensional highways. Or that Devokan's location and having its own moderate dimensional well puts it at risk.

Even if the Infernals don't find it, those withdrawing from the Nation will want to destroy it... they are determined to bottle in the Infernals with a ring of molten, radioactive planets. They won't risk a break out. I have to do what I can to save Devokan and warn the people. I guess we either find a way to save it or hopefully follow the forest... which is entirely gone now. That means we have to find who is moving the village forest. I hope Quin and Holli can help. 

Now I need sleep and yet I'm afraid I will dream of the war... and the squee... where are they? And birds... last night they seemed frantic. Now they are silent. 


=== Quin's journal, 12 Jan 2010 === 
The tree village is now completely gone from our world: in what might be a sign of hope, the pavilion imager shows part of it in its new home.

However, I have just read warrior Nalates' report. We need to evacuate Devokan as a matter of urgency.

It seems that Nalates hopes that I might be able to find a way to hide Devokan in an out-of-the-way set of dimensions. I cannot -- such a thing is beyond the technology I have access to.

What I can do, though, is perhaps make use of something I have discovered from my Aunt Elspeth's journal. That might be enough to save our friends and some of what makes Devokan so precious to us.


=== Dot's journal, 14 Jan 2010 ===
Here's what we've sorted out so far. We're aiming to evacuate the whole village by the first week of February, while taking into account the possibility of Nalates' comrades needing some rest and food as they pass through.

Quin was most helpful for a change and cleared the Lighthouse of his experiments and associated clutter. The plan is to use the Lighthouse as temporary accommodation for those fleeing the destruction reported by Nalates.

Paislee is preparing huge batches of soup and bread, ready to be served from the inn to those that need it.

Holli and Artair, I hope, will be able to help take some of the island's more valuable items into storage -- the linking books, for example.

Nalates has expressed concern for the squees in particular. I suspect she might have something planned.

Jim has thrown his lot in with Paislee, Quin and myself, and will join us wherever we end up...

Quin was in a far more optimistic mood than he has been for a while. In her explorer's journal, his aunt described a land she linked to where reality seemed to span several historical epochs in close proximity. He suspects we could make a new home in this area and use underlying time distortions to confuse any pursuit. Another advantage is that it is part of the hinterlands of one of the largest independent nations of that particular world -- so civilisation and shops are relatively close by (Paislee likes this idea!).

We managed to link to the place, using clues in the journal. It does seem suitable for our purposes. So we shall be starting to move there in the days to come. 


=== Quin's journal, 16 Jan 2010 === 
Thinking of all that has happened over the last week, it is difficult to know quite where to start this report.

First, the spheres in Selenitica: These are similar to those that were in the tree village, though they are smaller and not so powerful (I managed to get a replacement monitoring device during my time in New Babbage). Perhaps they are merely recording the area?

Having said that, the mountains to the north of the area have gone, in a similar fashion to how the trees started to disappear, as Paislee mentioned in her diary on 30 December. If the disappearances follow a similar timescale to those of the trees, it suggests that Selenitica may be no more by the end of this month.

Meanwhile, the evacuation of Devokan itself is proceeding rapidly.

We've visited what will be our new home several times now. Paislee and Dot will be sharing a cottage looking out over the sea. A second cottage is nearby, ready for Jim. I shall be moving into a building strongly reminiscent of the Keep. The building will serve well as a base for what I will need to set up over the coming weeks. And I shall allow Dot to use the top room as an office for GoMa.

I have been able to set up a portal system in the new area. Explorers wishing to visit may link there from the Eder Gira steam vent portal, or from the Devokan Nexus in front of the Inn. Note that I will be taking the Devokan Nexus offline in a week or so for safety reasons.


=== Dot's journal, 19 Jan 2010 === 
Devokan Island has experenced an early spring. It is almost as though the land knows its days are coming to an end (the most recent readings indicate 7th February), and it has responded with colour and beauty.


=== Nalates' journal, 21 Jan 2010 === 
I'm feeling more melancholy... somewhat at a lost for what to do next. My feelings are so mixed... sorrow and loss... friends... service teammates gone. My battalion is disbanded... a surprising loss. There is still a smoldering anger and hate... I feel a need to shower and clean myself when I dwell too long in those thoughts. I'll have to work them off eventually. I will likely find a strong faction used to fighting in the dimensional wars. Join them and work off this anger... maybe...

The team assigned to handle this planet arrived. They are in orbit. They had my information that I would be here. I advised the Devokans they were here, orbital space station. They are on standby alert, so we won't see any of them on the surface. I suspected the quick seasonal change was their doing. Whether they are just saving nukes and nudging the planet out of orbit or [name scribbled out] is just trying to flirt with me I have no idea... he isn't past messing with an entire planet to serve his purposes. Why do I attract these crazy men? 

Sleeping is still a problem. I'm usually up patrolling at night... I hope I don't alarm those Devokians still here. I've been heavily armed. Trying to compensate for being surprised and nearly dying I guess. Three large caliber automatic weapons, three katana blades and a load of ammo... that's probably over doing it, especially with the station in orbit above. Most Devokians have evacuated... Patrolling is a better explanation than admitting to the nightmares. I stay up until I can't stay awake any longer... a few strong drinks and I can mostly pass out and not dream. I can't keep this up... my eyes look so horrible the makeup is not covering it.

The light tower is the best vantage point to watch the village from. I come and sit by the pond to take a break. I love it here. I'm really going to miss this place... 

The squee are here. Now that it is warm they are running all over nibbling at the blossoms and new growth. They seem blissfully happy. I've decided to take them with me when I finally leave. I'll build a trap. I've seen the deer. She is very calm... almost domesticated it seems. I think I can capture her without hurting her or scaring her too much. The stork may be a problem... I'll never be able to trap all the birds and care for them until I can transfer them... may be I can use the sphere on the land the forest village was moved to... the Devokians decided to name it Devokan... that gets confusing... but there seems to be controls there. Quin has said a few things about Elsepth... I don't understand... I thought that was the name on one of the tombstones here... Quin went to see a solicitor and that appearently had something to do with Elsepth and her journals. Quin has been absorbed in whatever is in them...

Whatever... I'll travel to New Devokan and see what I can do with the sphere controls... between my equipment... geez they let me have tons of stuff... all I could carry off the planet... I got some really good stuff so I should be able to detect most of the life on Devokan. If I can use my equipment to target and the New Devokan sphere controls... I might get most of the life here to New Devokan... that seems a worthy effort for me... I like it. Certainly better than... well... forget that.

I have a few teammates that will stay with me for a day or two as they decide where they are going next. One is talking about another universe named Arda... or something like that. I'll probably travel there and check it out. I traveled to Winterfell Reverie where Dot, Paislee, and Quin have moved. It's a primitive place. No real technology to speak of... but it is nice. This is nicer... I'll explore there. I have taken a place in Minkartah for now. I have it stacked to the ceiling with ammo and weapons...

I'm getting nervous... I know it's my mind... but walking patrol seems to help...


<pb>=== Dot's journal, 22 Jan 2010 ===
Today the area next door to Devokan disappeared -- we can no longer sail or fly there. It is almost as though the island of Devokan itself is enclosed in a bubble, an invisible barrier we hit each time we try to move outside its boundaries.

I have just finished packing away my belongings in the Keep, including my trusty laptop. It might be tricky using it in the new place -- there is no electricity, and being in permanent twilight it is unlikely that the solar panels I used in Devokan will work.

The KI dispenser is in an enormous packing crate. I'm hoping it might be possible to reinstall it in our new home. We'll see.

It's sad, in a way. I've just been speaking to a visitor to the island -- 'Is there no way to save it?' he asked. 'It is worth fighting for.'

No, it's not possible. Events are underway that are outside our control. All we can do is try to save what we can from here, and move on. 

<pb>=== Nalates' journal, 23 Jan 2010 ===
I'm feeling better... I've been able to sleep more... the nightmares are less intense... Devokan may be healing my mind... that and my friend coming down to spend time with me. We talked about the battles we were in and shared feelings I doubt the Devokians would understand. Sleeping wrapped in his arms helped more than I imagined. My standing guard over him I think let him sleep well too. I still patrol to avoid sleep, just not as much.

Holli and her friend are busy. I have not intruded on them. Quin seems to be avoiding me. I wonder if I did something. Dot and Paislee are frantically moving things out of Devokan. I've spoken with Dot in Winter Reverie. She talked to someone that had talked to Quin. I guess we are both on some list of his...

Dot has moved her Keep to Winter Reverie. Paislee has a nice place there too. It is winter there... cold, snowy... but beautiful.

I made the trip to New Devokan. I can't figure out how to work the sphere controls. Actually I'm afraid to mess with them. It seems Selenitica is being moved now... hard to tell. I was able to study the process. I thought I could duplicate it. With the surplus equipment I took from The Nation I built a hybrid of the technology I know and the New Devokan process. Test transfers of a few birds from Devokan to New Devokan have worked. They all seem healthy, but confused. I'll check back and see that they are still ok. I wonder if the swan will remember me.

The squee are a puzzle. When I didn't know if the transfer would work, I thought capture might be the only way to move them. I was able to capture several of them. They vanish from the cages. I saw one disappear while I watched. I suspect they teleport like the Barho I first saw in The Cavern on Earth... that seems so long ago.

I now have only two squee. They are the two I made friends with near my mediation place in Devokan. I hope its friends... I suspect it is the food bribes the greedy little beggars love... If I sneak up on the cage, they are often out nibbling on blooms and seeds... or chasing each other and playing. As soon as they see me they POP back in the cage, which supports my idea they can teleport. These little clowns act like they were never caught. Brats. I dutifully feed them strawberries from the Inn. I have hopes they will let me take them to New Devokan. 


<pb>=== Artair's journal, 25 Jan 2010 === 
I've got a bit of news to report, myself. The pavilion in the Northern part of the island has disappeared. Dot told me about it when I arrived, and we headed down to take a look.

It seems that something's taken its place now. A large stone archway. I'd put it near fourteen feet high, ten feet wide, with the middle opening being only enough for a single person to pass through it. I'd have to get an older photo of the pavilion to confirm, but I believe it's the same one that was pictured for a while on the pavilion's surface.

The middle opening of the gate seems to be filled with the same energy as the pavilion had, and it does project an image. One of the tree village. It might be a connection to that world, the one where everything might end up. Dot mentioned that it's been transporting living things, essences of plants, perhaps we can organize a team to send something - or someone - through to gather data? 


<pb>=== Paislee's journal, 25 Jan 2010 === 
I've been reluctant to write an entry in my journal these past weeks... So much is happening that I simply didn't know where to begin. It appears that our suspicions about the spheres was correct... how could I not believe it now?

On one of my last forays into the large trees to the north (which is now gone altogether!) I chanced to step too close the the rotating surface...I found I could not escape its grip. Instead I was enveloped in a warm, soft glow that was hypnotic. My fear vanished ~ replaced by a calming doziness...

I awakened, my cheek pressed against some rough-hewn boards. The sound of gently lapping waves, birdsong, and chirping of insects filled my ears. I thought I had merely fallen asleep from exhaustion, but as I looked around I was astonished to find this was not the familiar island of trees I'd visited so often from Devokan, but a new place!

Gathering my wits, I decided to explore this place...would there be a way home? The trees looked different here, and the pathways were strange. I made my way up some spiral stairs that hugged a giant trunk to a good vantage point where I observed three islands across the shimmering sea. Perhaps there were natives there? But I had no way to reach those islands...

Continuing upward I came to a series of elevated walkways connecting a couple of huts and some platforms... But what caught my interest immediately was a small glowing sphere. This sphere was rotating in place above a sort of stand... It seemed so like the large sphere through which I had been transported to this place...

Resolutely I reached out and placed my hand in the glow...


=== Paislee's journal, 26 Jan === 
My previous entry was cut short due to a messenger announcing the arrival of small package marked: To Miss Paislee Myrtle, Devokan Island. Imagine my surprise when I saw it was from the same solicitors that Quin had visited.

But the most startling observation was when I noticed the cramped scrawl of Miss Elspeth's hand on the back of the string wrapped package. It read: Dear Paislee -- Remember dear girl, that every ending creates a new beginning! Miss Elspeth

I've yet to open the small package...I'm rather reluctant to discover what it contains, so I've placed it in my trunk. When the time feels right I shall open it.

Now it's time to relate the next episode of my strange journey....

"Stop! Do not touch that sphere, Miss Paislee! You will disturb its resonance and my work here will be undone!

Astonishment filled me as I turned to see a very familiar face...that of Quinquifid Oddenfen! While I stood their gaping like a fish he explained briefly that this sphere was a sort of hub for a system that allowed him to travel here to the world I had stumbled into.

Then, as he sometimes does, he started peppering me with questions! How had I arrived? What signs of change were there in Devokan? Had I seen Miss Dot or the other residents lately? Has anything on the big island gone missing?

His barrage of questions was quite exhausting after the stress of my unexpected journey, so I smartly informed him of that fact! At once he apologized (always a gentleman, albeit a reluctant one) for his vigorous questioning.

Luckily he had established a small camp at a neighboring island and swiftly led the way to a sort of portal...At least that is what he called it.

An image of our destination shimmered in the opening, so with a little encouragement from Quin I stepped through...

Ah! I hear steps on the stairs. I must leave my writing for now. Dot has promised to help me sort out the most important items in the inn to pack in preparation for leaving Devokan.

I shall miss my home. How I hope Elspeth was right and that this painful ending will lead to a new beginning.


<pb><p align=center>=== FAREWELL TO DEVOKAN === 

<p align=left>=== Quin's journal, 1 Feb 2010 === 
I am pleased to report preliminary results of some experiments.

When I originally visited with warrior Nalates the source of the glowing orbs, I took careful measurements of the multidimensional aether through which we travelled. 

By working through the notes I took at the time, analysing samples I collected in the other world, and carefully reading critical entries in my late aunt's journal, I was able to set up a system whereby I could return at will and conduct further investigations and experiments. 

The portal Miss Paislee refers to in her journal I have managed to re-create -- rather to imitate -- in Devokan. It is something of a mash-up at present, re-using elements from the old Devokan portal system, but will serve as we move from the island to our new home in Winterfell Reverie.


<pb>=== Quin's journal, 3 Feb 2010 === 
The next stage of my investigation is this: to attempt to take across at least some elements of the Lost Pages sphere from this world to the other. 

Accordingly I have set up an adaptation of the monitoring device, adjusting it in the light of the data gleaned from experiments in that other world.

The process will take a day or so to complete, but after that the Lost Pages sphere will no longer be in this world.


<pb>=== Quin's journal, 5 Feb 2010 === 
I linked back to Devokan to check how things were going with preparations for the final evacuation and to tell the others of my plans: the laboratory I set up in the new world, and some of the equipment I have been able to bring across.

My hope is to tap into the growing strength of the sphere above the standing stones that have reappeared in Devokan. 

It will be a risk -- I don't completely understand the underlying mechanisms -- but given the choice between that and the complete loss of that wonderful island, one worth taking.

So I am going to stay in the new world, monitoring the instruments, trying to control and focus whatever it was that enabled this transport of living and non-living matter, and that was growing strongly by the hour. 

I shook hands with each of them, wished them luck (as they did me), and returned to the spheres' source world.

Devokan is no more.


As I watched from my temporary lab in the spheres' source world -- the New Devokan as warrior Nalates likes to call it -- over the last few hours, one by one the monitors went blank.


First Selenitica's satellite mine, 

then Selenitica itself, 

then the Lost Pages sphere,

then the beautiful island of Devokan.


I weep. 

<pb>=== Nalates' journal, 9 Feb 2010 ===
I'm somewhat sad at Devokan's loss from this dimension and time but so many new things are happening there is little time to mourn. Word has come from the former DRC members that alarms were tripped in the Cavern on Earth. I have yet to sort out all those goings on, but the D'ni Refugees are gathering for a party and working to find out if they can get into a reopened Cavern. Seems KI batteries are in short supply or something.

While I wait I'll write down my account of the final hours of Devokan before the memories start to fade. It's sunny in Minkartah and a squee is curled up in my lap sleeping. It's not Devokan but it is nice. Raining at night.

Many of the D'ni Refugees came to see Devokan before it vanished. Some I had never met in my travels. Many I had never come across in the Cavern either. All were appalled that Devokan must go and struck by its beauty.

Many people were exploring in the final hours and catching up with old friends. 

I heard Quin went to the new world to try and save as much of Selenitica and Devokan as he could. I had hoped to save the animals and some of the plants. Quin spoke to Dot about saving more of Devokan. I doubt he has time to experiment. I ran out of time with my experiments and just started moving critters as I could. I figured I would just barely get my transfers done before Devokan starts to scorch. So, I could not stop and coordinate with him. I hoped our simultaneous transfers worked. I have yet to be visit the new Devokan to see how thing faired.

I have pictures of Selenitica before the orbit changed much. At this point everyone was out, except me. My scanners were showing no humans. The energy the spheres were creating was awesome. Dot said Quin was hoping for some resonance to increase the transfer rate. I would guess he found it. Way to go Quin.

The flier was here. No one was aboard. I was surprised at the time Dot left it there. I would have moved it to Winterfell but it is keyed to her somehow and won't respond to me. That's good because I realized when she sent her pictures that she had plans for it. I should know to trust her more by now.

What I call the crystal mine was empty. The crystals there seemed to be resonating with the spheres. Anywhere close to the crystals one could feel the vibrations. Set my teeth on edge... Wooh! Glad I did have to not stay there long.

The volcano was much more active. More lava pools had opened. The CO2 and sulfur gassing was not too bad. I remember coming up to Selenitica to warm up during the Devokan winter. Toasty nice. Now the pops and bursts of magma would make that risky.

My scanner had problems with the underground mine. I made a patrol of it to make sure no one was exploring or mining.

I destroyed the locking mechanism at the mine entrance to keep other out. Then the door activator to seal it too. The mine is big. It is completely out of character for the technology I see in Selenitica. I can't imagine who made this mine. Technology there rivals much of what I've seen in forward times. I'm still puzzled.

After riding the elevator down into the mine I destroyed its control too. I didn't want anyone using it to sneak into the lower levels behind me or escape past me and be trapped.

Searching through all the twists and turns of the mine was time consuming. 

The strange portal was still operating. I really dreaded having to use it to leave the mine. I felt it was the only way to assure the mine was empty and no way in was left. As always it was painful. Dang.

Dot's pictures show what she and some friends observed from her ship in the last hours of Selenitica. I'll visit the new Devokan or Winterfell and catch up with Quin on whether the transfer worked. My main hope is that he saved the Lost Pages sphere.

As the transfers continued eventually the Devokan island was barren. Not even a cricket was left. As I write now I find I am somewhat proud of that. I suppose some will be unhappy that I took the ants too. Oh well. My little squee friend won't complain... or I'll stop feeding her the strawberries she seems to love. 

I had decided to stay as long as I could in case someone might not have heard and come to visit. I would have needed to hurry them out. But, I had the island to myself. The farther out of orbit the planet moved the faster it moved toward the sun. The sky began to change.

At first the atmosphere started to thin and the lighting was harsh.

Soon things really began to change. Some of the colors were spectacular. It was as if all of the sunsets this Devokan was ever to experience were to be rolled into one final sunset.

As the planet spiraled in closer the sky and sun got brighter. By this time I was feeling the planet warming. Finally things were getting hotter and smoke began to cloud the sky. I decided it was time to leave. Heaven help any that came after I left. Only a couple of hours could have been left. So... hopefully...

If anyone had seen me leave... I would have blamed my tears on the smoke...

Now this Devokan is gone. ... Oh... the squee has woken. I'd swear she sees the tears that formed in my eyes as I wrote. Dang, I'm embarrassed to cry in front of a little squee... too much time spent with male military types... aaw... she has climbed to my shoulder and is nuzzling my ear and neck... I think she is trying to comfort me. I wonder how smart these little squee are? Whatever... it is nice. Certainly deserves a strawberry or two.


<pb>=== Fax Palladin's journal, 9 Feb 2010 === 
I've had this journal for a few weeks now, but this is the first entry. Avoidance, my old friend...

Such mixed emotions. Watching the livid skies over the old Devokan, knowing it would soon be gone -- even as word came of a renewed presence back in the D'ni Cavern, even knowing that there were multiple refuges for those displaced. It was still sad.

But there is hope. The words of Atrus, echoed by Yeesha, echo still:

The ending has not yet been written. The story continues...

<pb><font size=10>DEVOKAN FAREWELL

The sun is spinning close in the skies over Devokan
The squee and the crystals know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of the promises unspoken
And a land that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the tinkle of laughter
The magic that here was begun
And a time that we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing we've done

But we'll climb the hills once more, we will walk the woods together
Though it will be elsewhere, we'll meet once again
And every song we've sung will stay with us forever
We'll dance through the Ages and never say when

Under the moon, a new land lies waiting
Over the sea, the stars shine
New wonder behold, the maker's creating
The magic and music won't be left behind

After "Ashokan Farewell" by 
Grian MacGregor and Jay Ungar


<pb>=== Quin's journal, 10 Feb 2010 === 
Two solid days, sitting there in the laboratory, watching, adjusting a slider here, a knob there; hoping against hope that the conjectures and calculations about the spheres might have some substance to them, that my efforts might not be in vain.

Utterly exhausted, I emerged from the lab this morning, and linked.

The island was transformed! 

Somehow, the land had been remoulded into the hills and valleys of our lost Devokan. 

As I watched, rocks, streams, plants seemed to form out of the atmosphere -- a crystalline shimmering in the air, and then the wood, the waterfalls, the sounds, ...

I walked in a daze, looking around me in awe. It all fitted -- the geology, the ecology, all matched.

The island has come home.

Story

Book II

<font size=16 face=Courier>February to
May 2010

<pb>

<pb><font size=20 face=Atrus color=000000><p align=left>
I have compiled this chronological account from journal entries and notes written by individuals at the time. The events follow on from those chronicled by Dot Macchi in The Devokan Story: Book I, although I have repeated a few entries here in order to give some context to what follows.

My aim is to communicate the urgency and the reasoning behind my actions and research. 

Quinquifid Oddenfen
The Devokan Trust

<pb><font size=11 face=Courier color=221166>=== Places === 
Devokan -- the island on my original home world now destroyed by its own sun

Winterfell -- an area in another world where Dot Macchi set up a base

Areas in the spheres' source world:
Waysmeet -- the tree village transferred to this new world by the mysterious spheres (see Book I)

Devokan Touchstone -- the island I attempted to transfer across, a twin of the original Devokan

Tallis -- Mr Mahogany's home island

Skysong -- an uninhabited island over which I set up a sky laboratory and that I intended for my home

Curiosity -- the island that became Paislee Myrtle's home

Deepwater -- an ancient island of ritual and mystery; at its heart is a temple housing a "caged" sphere, hence the speculation that this is the source of the spheres' power

Nalands -- Nalates' island base

=== February 5 === 
I linked back to Devokan to check how things were going with preparations for the final evacuation and to tell the others of my plans: the laboratory I set up in the new world, and some of the equipment I have been able to bring across.

My hope is to tap into the growing strength of the sphere above the standing stones that have reappeared in Devokan. 

It will be a risk -- I don't completely understand the underlying mechanisms -- but given the choice between that and the complete loss of that wonderful island, one worth taking.

So I am going to stay in the new world, monitoring the instruments, trying to control and focus whatever it was that enabled this transport of living and non-living matter, and that was growing strongly by the hour.

<pb>=== February 10 ===

Two solid days, sitting there in the laboratory, watching, adjusting a slider here, a knob there; hoping against hope that the conjectures and calculations about the spheres might have some substance to them, that my efforts might not be in vain.

Utterly exhausted, I emerged from the lab this morning, and linked.

The island was transformed! 

Somehow, the land had been remoulded into the hills and valleys of our lost Devokan. 

As I watched, rocks, streams, plants seemed to form out of the atmosphere -- a crystalline shimmering in the air, and then the wood, the waterfalls, the sounds,...

I walked in a daze, looking around me in awe. It all fitted -- the geology, the ecology, all matched.

The island has come home.


<pb>=== February 16 === 
I have been here in the spheres' source world for nearly two weeks now. Most of that time has been spent monitoring the equipment, checking, adjusting.

I am feeling lost, bereft. This place is both Devokan and not-Devokan. Where is my home? Where do I belong?

Perhaps I have been pushing myself too hard. Must link back to Winterfell. Talk to someone.


=== February 17 === 
Where is everyone? I link back to the Keep building in Winterfell, and there is no one here!

Fortunately, Mr Fax Palladin contacted me soon after I linked in. The ensuing conversation was enlightening and helpful. 

It seems that in the same weekend that Devokan was destroyed (and Mr Palladin was there to observe it), access to the Uru cavern was regained. That might explain why no one is here in Winterfell. Miss Dot was one of the exiles from the D'ni city -- she would be eager to rejoin her colleagues there.  


<pb>=== February 19 === 
I have taken Mr Palladin's advice. I have gone to the cavern.

The initial dream? vision? as I first linked in was most poignant: Destruction has indeed come to us at Devokan...

Must find a way, make a home...


=== February 22 === 
Keeping myself busy with exploring, experimenting, writing.  

It all helps a little, but the black mood upon me is strong. 


=== February 25 === 
A chance encounter with Miss Dot's friend Ametist in the Uru cavern. She suggested I spend some time alone, taking the Journey, the one that starts in the desert.

Picked up some supplies from the Keep (enough for a fortnight) and left a note for Miss Dot and Miss Paislee -- they might be getting concerned about me. Not seen them since the 5th of February. 


<pb>::: M A R C H :::

=== March 1 === 
Received a KI mail from Miss Dot, requesting a meeting. She and others would like to visit spheres' source world, possibly to develop a base there. 

Sent KI mail back suggesting that we met up in Eder Gira. 

Mood is beginning to lift at last.


=== March 5 === 
As arranged, Miss Dot arrived at Eder Gira and, after helping me with those troublesome fish baskets, we linked back to my Relto and from thence to the Keep at Winterfell.

There I explained how to link to the spheres' source world, and potential problems and difficulties. Dot was not to be persuaded otherwise: she was determined to visit this other world -- she said how some friends of hers were about to lose their own home base in a world called There, and how she hoped there might be a possibility of finding a place for them in this new world.

So we linked. For once, the journey went remarkably smoothly. Things seemed much the same as I had left them. My laboratory in the sky was still intact, though the machinery sounded as though it could do with a few more squirts of oil.

Dot was most interested in how the small sphere was held in place. I based that machine on a more primitive kind I found in what I assume is a temple of some description, on the island I have called Deepwater. (Though I say 'more primitive', if I am honest with myself, the magnitude of the flux measurements I took in Deepwater astonished me: that 'primitive' mechanism is able to cope with forces far greater than I would like to test in my laboratory.)

I warned her not to get too close to the sphere: it hovers over what warrior Nalates would call a space-time 'wormhole' -- an ugly term ill-suited to the depth of beauty and majesty that can be glimpsed within it.

We then descended to the island of Skysong and from there to the transported island of Devokan Touchstone.

There, to my shock and Dot's immense surprise, we were greeted by a man. She had met Mr Mat Mahogany before; the last time in Selenitica, when it was about to be burned up by its sun. He was there in his spaceship and helped with the evacuation. 

The subsequent discussion we had, which lasted into the small hours of the morning, is likely to have momentous consequences in the days to come.

Mr Mahogany took us to his home island of Tallis in the spheres' source world -- many miles by sea, though a few seconds by his teleportation device. 

We were shocked to recognise that it had the familiar terrain of Devokan, though the buildings were alien. Yes, in this new world there are two islands with the same terrain as Devokan. Mr Mahogany was as puzzled as we were.


=== March 9 === 
Because the instruments I have in place in the laboratory over the island I have called Skysong, next to the transported Devokan Touchstone, were indicating a further build-up of flux in the spheres, I decided to investigate further.

I linked back to the Keep at Winterfell to pick up some more equipment.

Just as I was placing the last device into its heavy-duty travelcase, Miss Paislee turned up, full of curiosity about what was happening. She asked if she may return with me -- for she had been struck by that world's eerie beauty when she had inadvertently been linked there before.

I was initially reluctant, because of the potential instability. However, she was most insistent, and so I agreed.

We linked, and at once Miss Paislee saw the cause of my unease: the two islands sharing the same terrain. What is more, Tallis and Devokan Touchstone are now side by side -- something I had not expected! I have heard of parallel universes, of course, but seeing this happen in reality was quite startling.

I am hoping that Mr Mahogany might be able to shed some light on this mysterious occurrence.


<pb>=== March 14 === 
Today Miss Dot and her friends said goodbye to yet another world in which they had made homes during the exile from the Cavern. I found her account of the event quite moving:
------
An hour before the world known as 'There' was due to vanish, I linked in to Uru Island where many from The Meeting Place hood and other friends had gathered.

I left after a little while, to spend time alone in Eder Devokan, the mountain valley in Aurora Island that sengel, Ivy and I had purchased deeds for in early May 2008. Slowly, I walked around the neighbourhood, saying a personal farewell to Eder Devokan, and to each of the areas so carefully developed and built by people like Paislee, Ilf, Lareh, blutec, Ivy, sengel, Stejovis, as well as remembering those by JimQ and Nynaveve.

As midnight approached, I climbed to the top of sengel's waterfall to watch and wait. A few seconds after taking one last photograph, I blacked out. Destruction had come.

I awoke a moment later in Relto. I checked my KI, and saw one by one the names of friends and neighbours appear on the list. They too were linking to their Reltos. I used the hood book and waited there, by the fountain. And so we gathered -- an exodus from the world many had made their home since the first exile from the Cavern, together with friends who had known no other. It was an emotional time for many.
------

After this, Miss Dot had linked back to the Keep, but Miss Paislee and I had not returned from our travels. So once again -- this time on her own -- she followed my earlier instructions and made it back to the spheres' source world. 

We discussed what should be done next. Miss Paislee spoke of her intention to remain in this world, to maybe settle here. I will continue with my research over Skysong. Mr Mahogany has made us all most welcome here. 


=== March 21 === 
Miss Paislee sent me the most charming note:
------
Looking out over Curiosity toward Devokan Touchstone this morning,  I finally feel I'm home in this new land. Ships at anchor offshore promise adventure and new friendships. The strange familiarity of my new surroundings brings comfort and ease.

Busying myself with settling in here has soothed the loss of our beloved Devokan. Life is strange... The old saying about the closing of one door opening another has come true for us.

This house on the hill is for all to share -- a place enjoy the sweet music of this new world, to remember old joys and shared experiences of the past, and to savor the company of friends, both new and old.

Only meant to write a quick line! Must take my leave to lay a fire in the fireplace and prepare for company...

I wonder what the future holds?
----


=== March 21 === 
I have copied this entry from Mr Mahogany's journal. 
------ 
I have been looking everywhere I can, but still I cannot find my old diary. I had it before the light and the planet shook, and I lost my mind. All that remains of it was one entry I found on the floor, torn from my book. 

The gentleman called Quin has given me a new  book, as a gift to make my record. And so I write today as though it was the first day, the new beginning to my life.

Today... I have only just found my senses, I believed it all to be a dream, and that each day that passed, I would rise up, and see old familiar ground. But as each day passed, that dream faded, and so I have come to realise, finally, that from now on, this is what is, and all that was has been. It is no more.

I notice, it is different here. Not just because of the way that the islands are now merged and mixed up, but in other ways too.

I feel a sort of tingling in the air.

There is a metal taste in my mouth, and the smell of the sea is very strong. The fish have left me too, so I have to go to other places.

I walked today, over the newly formed islands to explore. This was where I noticed the harsh flavours were more obvious.

The identical island named 'Touchstone' is possibly the most electrifying. I can feel the hairs on my arm rise up and my pulse quicken. As though I can feel the very insides of the planet want to pull me over.

It's different and I think it will not be the same again.
------


=== March 28 === 
Over the past week I have been systematically pacing the islands in a grid pattern, using a portable flux monitor to map out readings in each area.

While I would not put it quite so poetically as Mr Mahogany, I can confirm that there is indeed a build-up of activity on the island to the west of Tallis, the 'new' island of Devokan Touchstone that we suspect is the one that the spheres transferred across.

The flux is particularly strong towards the southeast, roughly where Miss Dot's keep was in the old world.


<pb>=== March 31 === 
Miss Paislee showed me a poem she has composed:

------
New Land

Tonight there is a glow about the land.
Shimmery glimmers evoke gentle thoughts.
Memories of times past, friends recalled.

Earthy scents waft from the soil
As fireflies rise from the soft new grass
To brush against our outstretched arms.

Dusk bestows its gentle touch upon us
Envelops us in its soothing silence.
A quiet celebration of life's goodness.

Peace to you, friends, in this new land.
------

It seems she has found a home here. If only I could feel the same...


<pb>::: A P R I L :::

=== April 2 === 
Miss Paislee and Mr Mahogany are busy building and landscaping. Miss Dot drops by occasionally to see progress. My work continues. I keep myself to myself here in my lab. 


=== April 4 === 
I have heard from warrior Nalates:
------
I am still having nightmares of the invaders. So, I did some searching using the technology I took from my destroyed home and what I learned studying the spheres and talking with you. I did not find the invaders. I feel better. Not yet at peace.

Exciting. I did find new worlds. One had an island I liked. I decided to "appropriate" it. Using the tech I have I moved it to the world we moved most of Devokan to. Unsure if I could pull this off, I planned to move it out to the west of Devokan in open water. It's still not completely stable. It phases in and out of existence. But, it is mostly there.

I remember my surprise at finding an old D'ni world in my search. It is mostly in ruins, totally uninhabited. My search gear would let me find single shrew on the planet. I'm certain no one is there. I found an interesting building. I did not recognize it as D'ni. But, there are traces of D'ni technology, records, various guild symbols... obviously some central meeting place for the old D'ni guilds. Considering the guild hall and palace in Ae'gura this must be some kind of outpost. I am so intrigued.

I decided I needed a base of operations and place to build tools to control the spheres and a power station. I'm still not sure how the spheres we have encountered are energized. As long as they are not completely in my control I have doubts about using the technology.

I've started building on the island... mine now I guess. I shipped and received the barrels from the old D'ni guild hall from Earth to here. I've started building storage for them in the new basement. I've got computer equipment set up to study the spheres and see if I can stabilize the island. Once I have my stuff working I'll try to pull the ancient building in. With any luck I can reach back and pull the building from a much earlier time when the building was in better shape. I suspect I better be careful. If I break it in an earlier time I might destroy the building in following times too. Then I might not be able to retrieve it.
------


=== April 9 === 
The flux around some of the islands continues to increase.  

As far as I can tell, there seem to be two separate processes at work -- one of which is causing quite drastic changes to the island of Devokan Touchstone. I met Mr Mahogany earlier today, and he showed me what was going on. He is somewhat concerned.

Tying it in with the systematic flux readings I have been taking over the last week or so, it seems that there is a direct link between flux intensity and amount of change in terrain. Devokan Touchstone now has a deep crack running its length, and parts of the terrain are being pushed (or pulled?) upwards. One example of the latter is in the SW corner, where readings were particularly high.

The other process my instruments have picked up (it has quite a different 'signature' to the other) -- I assume that that is occasioned by the smaller spheres over the ocean to the south of Nalates' island. They look an interesting development; I have not seen the spheres emit 'sparks' before. I must ask Nalates what she thinks is going on there.


=== April 11 === 
Nalates has responded:
------
I'm not sure how related some of these things are. I have one captive sphere and 4 or 5 semi-controlled spheres on my island and south of my islands. I have no idea if they are having an effect on Touchstone. If you see a connection, let me know.

The test sphere, the one I call captive, is in the building I'm putting up on my island. You can see it best from the third floor. The computer controls are in the basement right now. I adapted the computers I use to monitor the phasing in and out of the islands to control the spheres until I can get more equipment.

I have the "elevators" working. Traveling forward I brought back some technology and used it to make getting around easier.

The other spheres are being used to capture the old D'ni building I found. You'll find those to the south of my island in what was open water. Some of the terrain is being pulled across now. I am trying to slow the process until I can learn more about the spheres... or at least the process they use. The new terrain should be reasonably stable, for now.

One of the things I did notice is changing the energy source has shifted some of the effects in the sphere's process into the visible spectrum.
------


=== April 12 === 
Miss Paislee reported a dream she had:
------
Last night I had a dream.  It's not often I remember my dreams, but this one was a revelation from which I awakened trembling....

In my dream, I was wandering about these worlds -- free to travel where I chose. While crossing the mountain toward the pods, I stumbled in my dream. I must have hit my brow on a stone for I remember nothing until I dreamed.

In my dream I opened my eyes and beheld a wierd and wonderful sight! Spun out before me as far as my eyes could see was a giant weaving of string...like the web of a giant spider. But 'twas no simple circular web I beheld, but a weaving so cunning, so cleverly made of colored strands interlaced and folded back upon themselves that I could not comprehend it all.

The earth on which I stood was not solid earth. I could see through to the bones of the world... I could see through the mountain to Devokan Touchstone. In a panic I gazed upward and saw a giant net canopy enveloping everthing. Stunned... I realized I must be dreaming yet I dared not take a single step for fear I would fall through....

My senses returned and my forehead throbbed. Gingerly I touched my temple to see how badly I was hurt and caught a glimpse of my insubstantial hand! For not only was this world made of a giant's Cat's Cradle, but my hand was as well!

I don't remember waking from my dream, if it was a dream. But this morning I took a spade to the mushroom patch and dug a deep hole, thinking perhaps I could find the strings that bound the world in my vision.

The only thing I found was earth. Still... I do wonder if this world is all that it seems.

I am very uneasy because this morning I noticed a small bruise on my temple. Was it a dream... or real?
------


=== April 14 === 
I showed Miss Dot the cracks that have appeared in Devokan Touchstone -- they are deep, filled with water, criss-crossing the island. They are wider and more numerous than before; I cannot explain what is happening.

Fortunately Tallis seems unaffected, and nor is Curiosity, the island to the north where Miss Paislee is based.

It might be as well not to link directly to Devokan Touchstone at present. On the occasions I have tried, I have been struck by a kind of paralysis, unable to walk one step (I am able to link away from the place).


=== April 16 === 
Miss Dot met up with Miss Paislee on Wednesday. They linked to Devokan Touchstone together -- and experienced the same strange inability to move.

What was even more alarming to them was that most of the island was now submerged -- the cracks had opened up and merged. Yet in two places, the land had risen sharply upwards, some 50-60 metres.


=== April 20 === 
Miss Dot sent me a note:
------
I have just re-visited Devokan Touchstone.

An ugly red glow blights what remains of the land.

The sea, no longer calm, displays a turbulence driven from below. Debris from destroyed walled gardens swirls around, caught fast in whirlpools.

One of the elevated regions seems to be trying to twist itself free of the spiky grasp of this festering landscape.
------
I am very, very angry. I meant this to be a new home for us all.


=== April 21 === 
What might be behind what is happening?

Mr Mahogany, in an earlier discussion I had with him, suggested that the two instances of Devokan (i.e. Touchstone and Tallis) in the same world, and in such close proximity, might be caused by some error in the transfer process (which involved a temporary space-time wormhole between parallel worlds); one key parameter out by a factor of 10^-12 would be sufficient to disturb the meshing of the transferred Devokan (Touchstone) with the original island (Tallis) in the destination world.

Perhaps this turbulence is part of a restoration process, as a single instance is re-established.

On the other hand, perhaps it has nothing to do with the transfer process -- a more worrying scenario in that we do not know whether the turbulence and destruction might spread.

There may be parallels here with what Nalates is doing. Though if it is the former, a restoration process, I would have expected a better match between the 'signatures' of the spheres employed in her experiment and the flux over Devokan Touchstone. 

On a more intuitive level, the transfer process instigated by the spheres, though disturbing in some ways, was beautiful -- mathematically, aesthetically, harmoniously; this turbulence is chaotic, ugly, discordant.

So on balance, I would say we are faced with the latter scenario. In which case, how might we contain and constrain this dis-ease of the land? Might we be able to pool our resources, Nalates, Mr Mahogany, and I?


=== April 26 === 
While the turbulence is still there, and still has the potential to spread and poison its surroundings, it seems there is a way of working around it, of nullifying its effect and influence. Sorting out this will require close teamwork.

Mr Mahogany has been able to stabilise some new land to the south of his large ship, away from the currently blighted areas. Through use of his technology (closely linked to that of the spheres, it seems) he has transferred Miss Paislee's island of Curiosity complete with buildings and fauna.

Two further regions have been prepared to the east of Curiosity. The plan is to transfer Waysmeet and Deepwater here. While we have managed to build a replica of the terrain of Deepwater, the buildings and landscape details are proving a little more problematic. 

The set up is this: Mr Mahogany and I have added copies of the spheres that were involved in the original transfer to this new world to the existing Waysmeet and Deepwater. Then, copies of Nalates' adaptation to make a 'receiving' sphere are placed in the new regions.


=== April 28 ===
I need to try some further experiments on the crystals, but that equipment is still in Winterfell. Unfortunately the only building we have there now is Miss Dot's cottage. 

I left a note for her on the kitchen table:
------
Shorah, Miss Dot

You might have noticed that I have taken the crystal distillation experiment out of its storage case. My apologies for the short notice, but events in the spheres' source world seem to call for drastic action.

Of course, with the disappearance of the Keep, I have needed to find alternative accommodation for the furnace. I have therefore installed it in your cottage. One could see it as an alternative method of heating -- it might also prove efficacious in driving out the damp.

Your friend -- Quinquifid

A report from Nalates:
------
I'm lagging in writing to my journal. Time to get my feelings and thoughts down. 

Seems I set my islands far enough west of Devokan that I'm going to bed as Dot, Mat, and Paislee are getting up. And Quin... does he even have a schedule? I hear he has taken over Dot's living room with his stinky crystal tests. Note to self: STAY AWAY.... Peweee. Maybe I should make some land available to him. Big note to self: Set up weather station and determine prevailing winds, FIRST.

I miss friends. I need to travel to see them. My good friend has joined a group I have mixed feeling about. She is now high up in their organization and quit influential. She is a mentor and protector for me when I travel there. Just wearing the sign of her house is usually enough. Otherwise, it is too dangerous. My fighting skills are no longer a match for the warriors constantly involved in conflict. However, I look forward to seeing her and as a team we are still pretty bad.

Travel has problems... my island is still not stable. It seems to drift in and out of the dimension we moved Devokan to. I've updated my control software twice and still have not been able to stop the drift. I can only hope for about 24 hours of stability then strange things start to happen. All I can do for now is pull things back once I notice there is a problem, which I can't when I'm away traveling. I have older computers I might be able to upgrade with newer software... maybe a dedicated control device could do more... well... when I have time.

I see the ships to the east have sailed. It was nice looking out and seeing them. Which reminds me. I have to get the roof finished on the new building before the rains come... does it rain here? Actually, I have not seen rain here... yet. Hmmmm...

I see swans are back. None of them seem to remember me. A couple have started nesting on my island. Others are in Devokan. I wonder where the spheres moved them when I was moving animals... they seem to have migrated in. And squee... I haven't seen them in forever. The food I put out disappears. I guess I could set traps, not that any trap would hold a squee, but if it is some new critter I would catch it.

Mat and Quin seem to be playing musical islands. I see more spheres appearing. I think Mat and Quin are likely responsible. I still don't know who created them. So, we may have competition for control of them. I have to get full control. I have made the ones in the North Restoration area but I don't have a computer watching them. I sort of turned them loose. Now they are pulling something into the water there and it's turning red. Eck. I've to figure out what is going on with that.

One of the Devokan islands is breaking up, lots of lava and steam. I heard Dot was concerned. She probably is all over Quin to fix it... but, I think the island is lost. A huge ship is being built in open water. I hear Paislee is decorating it. I look forward to seeing what she does.

I better go check the computers...

The blight seems to be spreading and changing in nature. Skysong is now affected as well as Devokan Touchstone. As a precaution I have moved my sky laboratory from Skysong to Curiosity.


=== May 10 ===
Using some of warrior Nalates' adaptations of the spheres, Mr Mahogany and I have been able to move what was in the region of Waysmeet to safety. It is now to the east of Curiosity.

In an attempt to contain the spread of the blight, we have placed a containing dome over the main island of Skysong. Devokan Touchstone is probably too far gone to be saved.


=== May 17 ===
Over the past week, another island has been taken out of the path of the blight: Deepwater. It is now south of the transferred Waysmeet. The view from Deepwater looking across to Waysmeet and Curiosity is beautiful -- such a contrast to what is happening further north.

The blight continues to affect Skysong. The containing dome might have slowed it a little, but each day more of the landscape succumbs to its poison.


<pb>=== May 20 ===
Matters are coming to a head. Using some of the same processes that seem to power the spheres Mr Mahogany and I have been able to transport the two islands so far unaffected by the blight to new places -- one of them being Devokan Waysmeet.

However, Devokan Touchstone is lost, totally submerged. The fluxions above it -- most in the visual wavelengths -- are quite spectacular against the dark night sky.

The dome placed over Skysong has only slowed, not halted, the blight's progress; chasms are appearing now, as they did when Touchstone was first affected.

We have decided that the only option left is to wipe both Touchstone and Skysong from the map. This will take place within a week.


=== May 25 ===
This evening I watched the last direct link I had with my old home sink beneath an alien ocean. And as my companion talked about his dreams and hopes for the future, I witnessed my own being torn apart -- everything I had worked so hard to save and preserve all those months ago, utterly destroyed.

When the end finally came, and Devokan Touchstone and Skysong were no more, I turned aside, muttered some excuse and linked back to Winterfell, seeking solace in work.

Why such destruction?

First my home world of Devokan

This evening I watched the last direct link I had with my old home sink beneath an alien ocean. And as my companion talked about his dreams and hopes for the future, I witnessed my own being torn apart -- everything I had worked so hard to save and preserve all those months ago, utterly destroyed.<font size=15>

<font size=18>When the end finally came, and Devokan Touchstone was no more, I turned aside, muttered some excuse and linked back to Winterfell, seeking solace in work.

May 28
The experiments are not going well. I stoked up the furnace to burn as hot as it (and I in this miserable cottage) can stand, but still the pulverised crystal refuses to melt down.<font size=15>

<font size=18>At one point yesterday the fumes were so intense and acidic I had to rush out to the river and bathe my eyes to ease the stinging pain. Fortunately no one was around to see.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I should not have to do this sort of experiment without the correct equipment -- fume cupboards, goggles, etc. -- and without a proper source of power. But needs must.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I must find out why the transfer of the islands in the other world failed so badly.

May 30
I ventured outside today. The scorched flora I discovered close to the cottage bore witness to the noisome fumes I have had to endure hour upon hour for the sake of my science.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I have come to the conclusion that continuing the current experiment is futile. The equipment I have here is inadequate for what I need to do. I shall have to travel south and see what I can acquire from more enlightened climes and times.<font size=15>

<font size=18>So tomorrow I set sail for Caledon. I shall be away some two weeks, then return.

<pb><p align=center>::: J U N E  :::
<p align=left>June 12
The time I spent in the relatively civilised land south of this benighted place has been fruitful. From consulting the learned tomes within its libraries I have gained fresh insight into how I might enable the recovery of at least part of the old Selenitica. It will require some modification to the Tower foundations, but I am sure that can be effected without harming the building's elegant facade.

June 20
My thoughts are flailing, trying to spot SOMETHING that might be the key to achieving the desired goal. That is what I hope might be possible by putting ideas gleaned from the research these past few weeks with what I saw in the primitive temple area on the island of Deepwater: for at the centre of that ancient civilisation is one of the same type of spheres that seemed instrumental in transferring landforms between the worlds. It hovered above a deep well of water. About it the sages of that land had placed a golden cage, slowly turning on a vertical axis, in the opposite direction to the main external sphere's rotation. Might the cage be some control mechanism?<font size=15>

<font size=18>I am attempting to replicate the cage mechanism in the base of the Tower in Winterfell.

June 24
I am feeling a little more encouraged today. I found a slip of paper in my aunt's journal. Perhaps she too was subject to darker thoughts at times, and needed to remind herself that midnight does pass, that failure is not the end.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I have completed the cage mechanism. It proved relatively straightforward to reconfigure gears in the Tower foundation to control the necessary rotation of the cage, and already the water shows signs of agitation.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Now I need to leave it running in this world and set up a parallel mechanism in the other -- one that I can attempt to control, not the one in the temple area. I have found an isolated, uninhabited island perfectly suited for this experiment: "Lost Pages".

June 27
The mechanism is now in place in my sky laboratory above the island of Lost Pages. <font size=15>

<font size=18>Finding that I had time on my hands, I turned to face the grief and reality of the recent past. So, in the quiet and solitude of night, I roamed the islands of Deepwater, Waysmeet and Curiosity, drinking in their peace and gentle beauty.<font size=15>

<font size=18>On Miss Paislee's island of Curiosity, I found a memorial inscribed with strange runes -- Celtic? I took a copy of the page from my aunt's journal, and placed it in the memorial's shadow. I was not alone in my grieving, for a freshly cut flower had been placed on the stone slab top.

June 30
Once again I return to Winterfell from working elsewhere, and discover deep changes have occurred to the environment. I know that was one reason I suggested moving here when we discovered we needed to evacuate Devokan, but I admit to finding it more unsettling than I had anticipated.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I went on to check developments in the Tower. The water is still showing signs of disturbance, but no flux has yet appeared within the cage. This is a little troubling; I would have expected further change given the length of time the experiment has been running.

<pb><p align=center>::: J U L Y  :::
<p align=left>July 7
Success at last! When I visited the Tower today, a small flux sphere was visible within the cage mechanism!

July 16
I checked today whether the seed sphere was having any effect. It is! The basic structure of an area reminiscent of Selenitica is beginning to form in the upper reaches of the atmosphere above Winterfell -- including the geothermal elements so critical to me as a power source!<font size=15>

<font size=18>I am going to try to relocate the Keepsafe building up there. It will be so much more convenient if I am able to conduct my experiments free from discovery.

July 20
Problem: The Keepsafe is ready to move to its new place, and no longer in its old place overlooking the seas of Winterfell.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I go through my calculations one last time, and discover an error -- the weight I assigned to the building's stonework is an order of magnitude too low.<font size=15>

<font size=18>The flux generated by the small sphere in the Tower will therefore be insufficient to support the Keepsafe in the new place. (I have noticed before that the spheres seem to work better with basic landscape than with manmade structures -- particularly with massive ones such as the Keepsafe.)<font size=15>

<font size=18>I shall have to look for a lightweight building for my laboratory. And for my home, I shall use the Devokan Flyer.<font size=15>

<font size=18>But I do not think Ms Dot will be best pleased. She is fond of the Keepsafe building.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I'd better tidy things up as best I can. Then I'm heading back to Lost Pages. The experiments there are going very well indeed. Unlike here. Oh well.

July 24
Having ascertained that the monitors and mechanisms in the sky laboratory over Lost Pages region were working correctly, I decided to pay a visit to the island of Curiosity, where Miss Paislee has settled. This was the first time that I have ventured there in daylight since the painful loss of the transferred Devokan and my hoped-for island of Skysong.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I was not looking forward to confronting the evidence of my destroyed hopes. However, what greeted me in that island was so astonishing and surprising that such black thoughts were pushed to the back of my mind.<font size=15>

<font size=18>First, there was no sign of the sky island that had formed from the blighted remnants of my beloved Devokan -- the sky to the north of Curiosity was completely clear.<font size=15>

<font size=18>As I was standing there, looking up in amazement, I heard Miss Paislee's voice: "Quin! It is so good to see you! We have missed you. Where have you been for the past few weeks?"<font size=15>

<font size=18>I turned, and there was the lady herself. Greetings exchanged, Miss Paislee proceeded to relate what had been happening during my absence.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Now, the science underlying the strange spheres is not fully understood, but they seem to obey some of the usual rules of Newtonian physics. What Miss Paislee described could be seen as a classic instance of action and reaction. For at the same time as the land of Selenitica was being formed in this Universe via the seed sphere in the Tower, the sky island to the north of Curiosity had disappeared!<font size=15>

<font size=18>Unfortunately, the disappearance was accompanied by instability within Curiosity itself, manifested by a landslip that part destroyed the walkway along the cliff, and sent a small holiday cottage plunging into the sea. I was becoming most alarmed at that point in Miss Paislee's narrative -- and, if I am honest, feeling a little guilty that my selfish desire to restore something that I valued had resulted in such an event.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I questioned Miss Paislee closely about the exact circumstances. She assured me that no one was injured, and that nothing had been lost that was of value -- in fact, both she and Ms Dot, who was visiting at the time, had slept through it all.<font size=15>

<font size=18>But she was obviously excited by one consequence of the landslip. "Come, Quin, come and see what has been opened up!"<font size=15>

<font size=18>I followed her carefully down the rocks exposed by the slip. At the furthest edge, she pointed: "Do you see that opening, just above the sea surface?" I nodded. "We will need to swim for the next part," Miss Paislee continued.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I was a little alarmed by this, for it suggested that Miss Paislee had already investigated whatever it was, on her own -- and so I remonstrated with her, though to no avail; she simply laughed at me, and told me not to be so old-fashioned.<font size=15>

<font size=18>To cut a long story short, we dived into the sea, took a deep breath and swam under the rock portal.<font size=15>

<font size=18>For it was indeed a portal. Surfacing the other side, regaining my breath, I looked around. We were in a large cave, some 15 metres in diameter. An eerie light played on the cave roof. The air in the cave was fresh, suggesting that there was a natural vent somewhere.<font size=15>

<font size=18>We scrambled onto the rocky floor and made our way up the slope. Towards the top was a circular tunnel, its walls looking as though they had been smoothed by the action of flowing water over aeons. We followed the curve of the tunnel, the strange light I had noticed earlier becoming progressively brighter.<font size=15>

<font size=18>The sight that greeted me as we emerged from the tunnel... Well, words have failed me...<font size=15>

<font size=18>There are so many details and "coincidences" I need to think through and check out. More later.

July 25
The crystals in the cave we finally reached surprised me by their purity, size and colour. <font size=15>

<font size=18>A further underwater discovery I made this morning was a set of crudely made steps, leading down to the cave entrance. I asked Miss Paislee if she had seen them before -- no, she said, they too had been revealed by the landslip. Their presence suggested to me that the cave was possibly an ancient mine, of earlier period than the one at Selenitica, with the crystals again being the object of extraction. <font size=15>

<font size=18>However, these crystals are different from those in Selenitica. For one thing, they are silent whereas those from Selenitica "sang". For another, they are of several colours, while the Selenitica crystals were predominently white. Time to start analysing their composition, I feel. <font size=15>

<font size=18>While I was pondering these matters and how I might investigate them, Miss Paislee broke into my thoughts. And it turned out that my thoughts were not the only thing she had "broken into" -- for she had "broken into" the Tower close by, using a jemmy to force a way in to a previously firmly locked door. Again I remonstrated with her, and again she turned aside my justified concerns. <font size=15>

<font size=18>But what she had found there in the locked Tower was almost as intriguing as the discovery of the crystal mine: a set of old-fashioned but still usable laboratory items -- ones that would have been used by a scientist of the generation previous to my own.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Miss Paislee had cleaned the equipment as best she could, and had set it up as a small laboratory, clearly hoping it might be useful.

As I inspected the room, I asked about the chart of atomic elements Miss Paislee had fixed to the wall. Where did that come from? "Oh, I found that rolled up behind the desk in the study in the base of the tower," she replied. So there was another room? <font size=15>

<font size=18>It turned out that the tower base had also been subjected to Miss Paislee's burglaristic tendencies. We entered a small circular room, with spiral staircase leading to the top of the tower and various crates and sacks (all still unopened, which surprised me), and a slightly larger room beyond -- a gentleman's study.<font size=15>

<font size=18>"Capital!" I said, clapping my hands with glee -- then I realised I might have been presumptuous. "No, Quin, it is for you to use. And I have adapted one of the small pod-huts at the far end of the island, should you wish to stay here for a while."<font size=15>

<font size=18>As we walked along the coastal path to the pod-hut, I confessed that I was getting a little tired of camping out in Lost Pages. And while the sky laboratory had basic measuring equipment, it did not include what would be required for the more detailed work. I will be honest: I was touched by all these provisions.

July 26
Miss Paislee and I talked a little today about the investigations that might be needed to make sense of what the landslip -- and Miss Paislee's activities with a jemmy -- have revealed. <font size=15>

<font size=18>Miss Paislee offered to sort through the papers she had found in the desk in the study, to see if there were any clues about the equipment in the Tower lab, who it belonged to, and so on. "Although I cannot puzzle out the science... I do spend much time wondering."<font size=15>

<font size=18>"Excellent," I said. "That way we can develop some good ideas. Observations are key to science. You being here the whole time will be critical."<font size=15>

<font size=18>To my surprise, Miss Paislee said: "Yes, I did learn that... You know who I learned it from? You shall not guess, I think! Or perhaps you will... back on Devokan."<font size=15>

<font size=18>"Not my great aunt Elspeth?"<font size=15>

<font size=18>"Oh, you did guess," she said, slightly disappointed. "Many is the time I would discover her just gazing out her window... journal in hand... jotting down the weather and making notes and sketches of small plants and things -- and she said, "Miss Paislee, you should really write down your thoughts and observations on a regular basis!" That is why I began my journal... after her passing. A way to remember her and to help myself understand things a bit better..."<font size=15>

<font size=18>She went on to say: "I look forward to having you spend more time here. Dot will be pleased as I am."<font size=15>

<font size=18>I expressed my doubt, mentioning the little problem I had had with the Keepsafe building and my suspicion that that would ignite Ms Dot's fabled temper.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Miss Paislee disagreed: "Well, if you can convince her that it was all for a good cause, she is a reasonable woman. Do not worry, Quin. She has been concerned about you."<font size=15>

<font size=18>I am still not convinced.

July 29
I linked back today to Winterfell to check on developments.<font size=15>

<font size=18>A letter was waiting here for me from my solicitors, reminding me of my obligations under my aunt's will. It is time I put things into motion. <font size=15>

<font size=18>The research trust will need a complex of laboratories and workshops. The island of Lost Pages will be eminently suitable to use as a base for these -- remote, so no distractions. <font size=15>

<font size=18>So the next step is to commission architects to design and build what will be required.


July 31
I have heard via the Guild of Maintainers grapevine that Ms Dot is extremely angry about the loss of the Keepsafe. I have therefore decided, when in Winterfell, to use Selenitica as my base until her ire is cooled. The Devokan Flyer is already parked up there, and makes an excellent home from home, as I have experienced on several earlier expeditions.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Then Miss Paislee is encouraging me to continue to investigate what was revealed by the landslip in her new home world -- I shall be heading back there tomorrow. <font size=15>

<font size=18>I am feeling more positive than I have done for weeks!<font size=15>

<font size=18>I just need to make sure I keep out of Ms Dot's way.


<pb><p align=center>::: A U G U S T  :::
<p align=left>August 4
I have asked Miss Paislee if she might keep an eye on the architects I have commissioned to build the research complex on Lost Pages. She agreed, but went on to suggest that a research foundation needed more than mere buildings -- it also needed people to share the vision and work together to fulfil it. "What is it going to be called?" she asked.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I shall have to give these aspects some thought.

August 8
Ms  Dot has visited Curiosity and Lost Pages several times over the past two weeks. Fortunately, I have been able to avoid meeting her by linking elsewhere as soon as the alarm sounds on the communicator device we use in this world. <font size=15>

<font size=18>I shall have to re-establish communication with her at some time. But it needs to be on MY terms. <font size=15>

<font size=18>Perhaps the best thing to do would be to write a letter to her c/o Winterfell Reverie -- and to carefully plan any meeting and subsequent conversation. 

August 10
I have thought of a name for the research foundation: Devokan Trust, after my old home world, now lost. It seemed appropriate, given that the mission of the foundation is to "research and restore what was lost" -- that is, the links to worlds, ages or areas that have been destroyed or misplaced over time. Miss Paislee was quite taken with the name, and thought it suitable.

August 11
While diving in the seas off the northwest coast of Curiosity today, I spotted something half buried on the sea bed. <font size=15>

<font size=18>Swimming over to take a closer look, I could see various elements, scattered over a small area. What was exciting to me was that they appeared to be machined out of local materials.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I surfaced, and contacted Miss Paislee to alert her to my discovery. She immediately came over, and agreed to help. The plan is for me to try to free each item from its watery grave and to bring it to the surface. Then Miss Paislee will take it from me and place it at the base of the Tower.  

August 14
As far as I can tell, we have managed to retrieve all the items that were on the sea bed. Most seem to be in quite good condition, no rust or dents, in spite of their immersion in briny water and semi-burial. They were obviously parts of some machine. <font size=15>

<font size=18>Miss Paislee agreed: "I had thought that it must be parts of a single thing... based on the base I see here and the two large pipes that are attached. The pipes are symmetrically placed... and there are two circular metal pieces and this large glass globe..."<font size=15>

<font size=18>The most exciting find was an axle to which various local crystals (the purple and turquoise variants) had been attached. Might we have found parts of a motor?<font size=15>

<font size=18>Miss Paislee speculated whether the old lab notes she is steadily working through might yield information as to this intriguing discovery.<font size=15>

<font size=18>In the meantime, I will try to get the parts across to my workshop on Lost Pages for further investigation, the basic shell of which is just about complete.

August 15
I was working in the Tower Laboratory on Curiosity today when the communicator alarm sounded. I was ready for this -- time to put the plan regarding Ms Dot into action.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I continued working on the experiment -- testing the chemical composition of a particular type of crystal -- with my back deliberately turned to the door. When I heard her (admittedly quiet) footsteps on the bridge, I called out: "Just one minute, Ms Dot." <font size=15>

<font size=18>When I judged the time was right, I turned and started the conversation with: "I suppose you have come to berate me over the Keepsafe incident."<font size=15>

<font size=18>To my surprise, Ms Dot ignored that and instead issued an invitation to use an office area within the ancient Cavern city of the D'ni. So much for my pre-imagined confrontation!<font size=15>

<font size=18>Well, that piqued my interest. The civilisation of the D'ni would have fascinated my aunt, and I could see obvious links with her desired research foundation and what Ms Dot and her colleagues have been doing -- I did not mention this to her, of course.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Instead, I let her continue talking, while I listened. I admit that I was moved by some of what she said, but I was careful not to display a reaction. Finally, she lapsed into silence, obviously expecting a response from me: I agreed, on the proviso that work here takes priority.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I decided then to make use of the extra pair of hands, and asked if she would help me pack some items I have retrieved from the seas around Curiosity, ready for moving to the workshop on Lost Pages for further investigation. She agreed, though I could see that after two hours she was agitated about missing some meeting or other.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Still, the job is done, Ms Dot and I are communicating once more -- and I have a base in the Cavern! Splendid!

August 17
Today Ms Dot showed me around the office area -- Neolbah -- where I may work when visiting the Cavern. There are some very interesting mechanisms there -- some not working yet. As soon as Ms Dot left, I took a closer look. Unfortunately, my investigation caused one of the working doors to stick; I did not expect that to happen -- the mechanisms are less robust than I had thought.

August 20
I wonder whether Ms Dot might consider joining the Devokan Trust? I shall have to ask her when I next see her.

August 22
Ms Dot visited the Lost Pages region today, while Miss Paislee and I were inspecting current progress.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I am pleased to say that she has agreed to join us in working with the Trust, albeit on a freelance basis so as to preserve her independence. I understand her position. I would do it myself in her circumstances.

August 23
I returned to Neolbah today, but this time with a pocket set of tools. Ms Dot came too, wishing to work in the office.<font size=15>

<font size=18>While I was examining the door that currently does not open, I noticed an anomoly in the wall surface close by. I shouted to Ms Dot to come and see.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Once the covering was removed, it was clear that an inscription had been chiselled into the wall. I recognised it as in D'ni. Ms Dot sketched it on a notepad and said she was going to ask one of her colleagues based on Winterfell's world to translate it.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I stayed on, determined to make the door reveal its secrets to me. Though I wondered initially whether the inscription had any relevance to what might lie behind the door, I quickly dismissed that as mere speculation.<font size=15>

<font size=18>After an hour or so of not making any progress with the door, I linked out in disgust and returned to Curiosity.

August 30
I was busy working on an analysis of the electrical properties of the turquoise crystal type when Ms Dot barged into the Tower Laboratory and insisted I accompany her in some explorations of nearby islands. She has lost none of her bumptiousness since her resignation from the Guild of Maintainers -- if anything, it has become a little worse. Still, she does have some useful qualities for the Trust, so I make allowances.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Although a little irritated by the interruption, I decided it would be a good opportunity to do a preliminary survey of the underlying geology of other islands. So, having picked up one of the more portable instruments, we set off.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Ms Dot chose the island of Kamali for our initial exploration: according to the map, this is a sky island some four or five grid squares distant from Curiosity.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Getting there was more difficult than we had anticipated, requiring a dual link and then a dizzying trek across some sort of force-field bridge.<font size=15>

<font size=18>But the island is beautiful. Somehow I felt welcome in that place -- it is so rare that I have experienced that in this world outside of Curiosity, Deepwater or Waysmeet since the loss of my Devokan.<font size=15>

<font size=18>I turned my thoughts back to business, and powered up the portable surveyor. <font size=15>

<font size=18>The initial readings shocked me: they were displaying the same signature as that of the sky island that broke free from the blighted Devokan Touchstone! I need to investigate this further.


<pb><p align=center>::: S E P T E M B E R  :::
<p align=left>September 2
I returned to Kamali today, this time with the precision geo-surveyor. Manoeuvring it across the force-field bridge was not a task I wish to repeat.<font size=15>

<font size=18>But the results confirmed those I had taken with the portable device, and to a degree that cannot be denied.<font size=15>

<font size=18>Within the normal limits of experimental accuracy, Kamali and the sky island that originated from the blight are one and the same. How can this be? 

September 4
How could I have been such a FOOL not to have seen what was happening? Why did I close my ears to what Mr Mahogany was saying? I owe the man a deep and sincere apology. While I, in the blindness of my grief, sensed only blight and destruction, he saw birth and renewal.<font size=15>

Dot's Journal



<pb>


<pb><font size=14 face=Michelle color=000080><p align=left>30 May 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Quin's moods are becoming a problem. A pattern is emerging: after a period of intense work and concentration lasting several days (and, often, nights too) he becomes morose, spurning all company, unwilling to talk.<font size=9>

<font size=14>What is more, he seems not to be able to recognise what has been achieved by his efforts. This last period is a case in point.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I managed to catch hold of him when he linked back here from the other world. He muttered something about the experiment being a 'failure' -- that he had been unable to save the two islands -- and locked himself into his cottage.<font size=9>

<font size=14>He's forgotten that, just a few days before, he and Mat had managed to rescue both Waysmeet and Deepwater by moving them out of the path of stange blight. I photographed the islands in their new places, close to Paislee's home island of Curiosity. They are a joy to visit...<font size=9>

<font size=14>Throughout the day, the fumes belching from Quin's distillation furnace intensified to an unbearable level -- they even started to seep under the door of my own cottage! At that point, I decided to sit by the shore for a while, until the fresh sea breeze cleared my head. A little rabbit came right up to my chair, her antics a delight.<font size=9>

<font size=14>But how to snap Quin out of this mood?


5 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
I've been distracted. First I was away for a few days on guild business. Then, on my return, I discover Quin has gone walkabouts yet again. At least he had the decency to mention it to a neighbour before he went. On previous occasions he has been known just to disappear, causing no end of anxiety to the rest of us until he returns, totally oblivious to the search parties etc. organised on his behalf.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I suppose we have to accept and expect different norms of behaviour. It does irritate me sometimes, though.


7 June 2010 -- Neolbah
Still no word from Quin. I just hope he is not spending too much money; we cannot afford too much on fancy glassware for his experiments.<font size=9>

<font size=14>In the meantime, a maintainer colleague, Andy Legate, gave me a lovely surprise. On an unauthorised visit to the Cavern, while it was still officially closed, he found a way in, put together a makeshift boat and managed to sail from the underground city's ferry terminal across the vast orange-glowing lake to the other side. As he told me later:
-----
I found a small cave where I landed and wandered around, lost, for a day or two, when I stumbled upon a bigger cave with a walkway. As I made my way down it, when I got to a certain point, a gate came crashing down and I have not been able to get it opened back up. This walkway lead to the Atrium of Neolbah. Fortunately, there was a Nexus linking pedestal there with a book going to the Nexus and by using it, I was able to have a link to this place included in my KI.
<pb><font size=14>The upshot of all this is that over the last few weeks he has been restoring the area, which includes several rooms leading from the atrium, and when he heard I was looking for a base in the Cavern, he kindly offered one of the rooms as an office.<font size=9>

<font size=14>So the weekend was spent getting my laptop installed, and linking into the KI network, dragging some of the storecases into the atrium, and generally enjoying my good luck!<font size=9>

<font size=14>But what a contrast with Quin! Andy left notes explaining what was going on, even his shopping list (though I think the latter was left in error!).


11 June 2010 -- Neolbah
I'm really enjoying pottering around here. I've brought down some of the packing cases in which Paislee, Nyn, Quin and I hastedly stored items when we needed to evacuate Devokan back in January/February. I've stacked them by the entrance to the office -- before I did that, there was an awful draft coming through the passageway as I sat at the desk (you should see the lamps swinging in the breeze in the atrium!).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Andy has gone up to the surface to get some tools. He is intrigued as to what might be behind those other doors and is planning to work on them over the next couple of weeks to see if he can get them to open.


16 June 2010 -- Neolbah
Andy is making impressive progress in repairing some of the machinery in the area. Although the time zones we each live in are different, just occasionally I bump into Andy as he links in and I link out. It's strange how often he is muttering about the need for a coffee! But no power means no coffee. It also means that the D'ni number keypad he has freed up doesn't actually do anything as yet -- we're both intrigued as to what might be behind those firmly locked doors.<font size=9>

<font size=14>There must be some power somewhere -- the sparking blue button suggests that. But perhaps that is on a different circuit. I suspect that might be what Andy is working on at the moment.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I have learnt if he and I are in the age together, it's best if I stay in the office with headphones on. Andy's military background shows in his vocabulary at times. Equally, that way I'm less likely to trip over any tools he's using -- talk about an unorganised mess where he is working! -- though he does tidy them all away before he leaves.


17 June 2010 -- Neolbah
Andy has fixed the button that was sparking. I'm not sure what the problem was, but it is sparking no longer and we've been able to get into the room beyond. It is some sort of control room, judging from the levers -- none of which work at the moment.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The amount of coffee the man gets through! His intake rivals even mine!


19 June 2010 -- Neolbah
Had a good discussion with Andy today. He thinks some of the levers in the control room might be linked with the power system for the D'ni style numeric keypad by one of the other doors -- and possibly for whatever is beyond them. He's going to see if he can jury-rig the damaged system to get some power flowing again.<font size=9>

<font size=14>But that will have to wait. He's been called away on an urgent project -- he'll be back in a week. So I'd better go back to Winterfell and check that all is well there.


20 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Quin has at last returned from his trip away. It seems he spent the time in the research libraries of the city to the south of the wilder country of Winterfell. When I finally managed to buttonhole him for a chat, he was obviously thinking of something else. His eyes kept straying towards the Tower on the south-west of the island, and most of his responses were noncommittal murmurs.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I tried to explain that it would be really helpful to know a little more of what his plans are before he implemented them. But when I had finished saying all this, he shrugged his shoulders and stomped back to his cottage. I don't think my request registered. Argh!


21 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
It's time I started sorting out everyone's notes and journal entries from those frantic final weeks of Devokan's world. A neighbour here has expressed interest in including a copy in his library, and of course I too would like a copy to keep in Neolbah. I'll spend the next few days here, gathering the material, and then link back to Neolbah for a bit of peace and quiet to finalise the report.


23 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Quin has been working day and night on a project in the base of the Tower. It has some sort of machinery there; we're not sure what its original purpose was. He has adapted this to power a 'cage' mechanism similar to one in the spheres' source world, in what we think might be a temple on the island of Deepwater. He's still not told me of his exact plans -- he has been very evasive of late.


24 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
While taking a breather from the piles of notes and journals I've been working with, I noticed that Quin had at last emerged from the Tower and seemed to be packing for yet another trip. 'Where are you going this time?' I asked. 'To the spheres' source world' was his reply. Nothing more. Nothing about his plans, or when he was thinking of returning. What am I to do with him?


25 June 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Being intrigued by what Quin might have been doing in the Tower, I snuck across the water to investigate as soon as he had left for the other world. The sounds the machinery is making suggest it isn't running that smoothly. However, within the rotating cage, the water is showing some signs of agitation, with a mist forming at the cage's centre.


26 June 2010 -- Neolbah
When I linked in to Neolbah today, a rather nice note was waiting for me from Nye Sigismund, a fellow explorer.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I wrote a brief note in reply, then started work on the journal for the Devokan Story. Preparing it brought back many precious memories, both of times shared with others, and ones of solitude and quiet reflection.


27 June 2010 -- Neolbah
Heard from Andy today. He sounds very excited by the project he is working on. He hopes to be back later this week.


2 July 2010 -- Neolbah
Judging from the tools and notes scattered around the Atrium when I linked in today, Andy is back at work. I tried pulling the levers in the control room one by one, and some of them are definitely freer in movement. Some of them even make a noise.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Progress on the Devokan Story journal is slow but steady. It should be finished in a couple more days. I found some of my photos of the final hours of Selenitica today, and set them up as a screensaver on my laptop.


4 July 2010 -- Neolbah
I finished the Devokan Story journal today. It is quite a read.


5 July 2010 -- Neolbah
Andy's got the control room levers to work! Well, partly working -- it is a bit of a hack he says, since he isn't that familiar with D'ni technology. The levers definitely control the keypad by one of the doors, which in turn appears to control access through the door. But as I discovered when I tried working out the code, it is all too easy to mess things up...


7 July 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
It seems that Quin's experiment in the Tower is beginning to bear fruit. A small seed sphere has coalesced in the centre of the cage mechanism. I do hope Quin knows what he is doing. I haven't seen him for ages.


12 July 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
A letter arrived today, from Paislee. It seems I'm not the only one worrying about Quin's current state of mind:
----
Dear Dot,
It is out of a growing concern that I write to you today. Our dear friend Quin has been very much in my thoughts of late.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I know from your journal (and our conversations as well) that he has been based in Winterfell since the loss of our dear Devokan and subsequent journey to this new world. I suspect that he has fallen into a depression. Even at his busiest he always managed to visit briefly to check on the inn and to keep up with events.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I fear he has been missing far too long from his friends. I miss his visits... and I do worry for his well-being. Did you know I chanced upon him once outside his cottage? I called to him, but he didn't seem to hear me calling. He looked as if he didn't want to be bothered.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Perhaps some day soon you could visit Hilltop House and we could share some tea. I'd very much like to share my concerns with you in person. Perhaps we can devise a plan to encourage Quin. As you know, there are some unusual things here in this new world... Things which I believe Quin would find interesting.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Regards, Paislee
----


19 July 2010 -- Curiosity
Over the weekend I managed to spend a little time with Paislee at Curiosity, the island she has made her home. It is, in parts, an Alice-in-Wonderlandish kind of place -- intriguingly eccentric. It has lovely views over Devokan Waysmeet (the tree village) and across to Deepwater.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We discussed Quin's moods, of course, and what we might do to help. Paislee has found some old scientific instruments locked away in a tower on the northeast coastline of Curiosity -- she apparently took a small jemmy to the door (I said I didn't want to know the details). She's cleaned up the instruments and has set up a small laboratory in the tower, hoping that Quin might enjoy pottering around in there.<font size=9>

<font size=14>While I was there, something rather worrying happened overnight. A small landslip to the north of the island broke up the wooden coastal walkway and destroyed one of the Alice-type buildings. I had previously thought that the lands had stabilised -- obviously this is not the case.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The landslip seems to have opened up a cave; unfortunately its entrance is totally submerged, so exploring it further will need to wait until I get the proper equipment across. I wonder if Quin might be interested in this development...


25 July 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
I've just heard from Paislee. Apparently Quin turned up at Curiosity yesterday and spent most of the day there!<font size=9>

<font size=14>Paislee says he seemed like the Quin we used to know -- taking an interest in what she showed him, firing question after question at her, speculating aloud what it all meant. She saw none of the black mood and temper of the past few months.


26 July 2010 -- Neolbah
I've had a quick word with Andy about Quin. It would help all of us keep in touch if Quin were able to access my office in Neolbah, and maybe keep his journal there.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Andy said he had no problems with that, and would set this up as soon as he had the time (he's very busy with other projects at the moment).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Mind you, the last time I was working here, I heard someone link out just after I linked in. It wasn't Andy -- he normally shouts out a greeting or where he's off to now. The sound seemed to be coming from what I call the boiler room.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Strange. Perhaps there's more going on there than immediately meets the eye.


29 July 2010 -- Neolbah
Well, I still haven't seen Quin anywhere, but for some reason he has re-started posting notes on the GoMa forum. I suppose that is better than nothing, but I still need to speak with him face to face. There is a little matter of a missing building in Winterfell.


30 July 2010 -- Curiosity
Quin's report on the GoMa forum about the submerged cave spurred me into action. I rummaged through all the crates in Neolbah, trying to find my diving kit (I really must get around to listing the crates' contents -- we didn't have the time during Devokan's evacuation).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Finally I plugged in the OSgrid reference I'd noted before into the HIPPO transporter -- curiosity/190/230/33 -- and linked...<font size=9>

<font size=14>It was early morning. The air smelt fresh and alive; the grass sparkled with dew.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I caught a movement out the corner of my eye, to my left. I turned, clambered up the rocks and found a metallic contraption, turning in the stiff morning breeze. Some sort of forced ventilation? I wondered whether Quin and Paislee had cobbled this together after their exploration of the cave below.<font size=9>

<font size=14>But this was not what I came here for. So I insinuated myself into the diving kit and slid off the rock into the sea.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Underwater the light was surprisingly good. I saw some rough steps hewn into the rock near the cave entrance. I hadn't seen those before -- had they too been exposed by the landslip? What did their presence imply?<font size=9>

<font size=14>Carefully I picked my way through the tumbled rocks and swam upwards into cave itself. Remarkable.


10 August 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
I'm juggling so many projects and deadlines at the moment that my journal is getting a little out of date. Andy seems to be under a similar workload -- though he did send me a note recently that he hoped to be able to do a little more work in Neolbah soon.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I've still not managed to get hold of Quin to let him know of the offer of shelf space in Neolbah, though Paislee has been in touch to say he is working on something on her island. However, when I tried to link there to have a few words with him, the communicator showed that he linked straight out before I could catch him. I've since heard via the GoMa grapevine that he is deliberately avoiding me because of what happened to my Keepsafe building during one of his infernal experiments.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Paislee says Quin has commissioned an architect to develop a research complex on Lost Pages -- she is meant to to keep an eye on their progress. This is part of the Foundation his aunt's will charged him to set up, apparently.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Meanwhile, back at Winterfell Reverie, the land where the Keepsafe was has been taken over by a gypsy encampment. I've only spoken to the man so far -- a pleasant fellow, who sounds like he might have a few stories to tell himself. Their horse is certainly enjoying the sweet grass! I wonder if they would mind if I collected the end result for my roses...


15 August 2010 -- Neolbah
Isn't it always the case that just when you are about to leave for an important meeting, the phone rings?<font size=9>

<font size=14>In my case, it was the All Guilds Meeting in Kirel that I missed as a result, though it wasn't so much a phone call but an alert from Paislee on my iPhone cross-world communicator app.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We had previously arranged that when she saw Quin was fully engaged in one of his experiments, she was to contact me urgently.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I decided to use stealth mode to link in (we joke about 'ghost Dot', for I sometimes appear as a small cloud in these circumstances). Paislee said he was working on Curiosity, in the Tower Laboratory she had managed to set up for him.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I cautiously crossed the wooden bridge to the lab's entrance, hoping it wouldn't creak. Sure enough, there was Quin, muttering away, hunched over the workbench, surrounded by chemicals and fancy glassware -- and mess.<font size=9>

<font size=14>'Just one minute, Miss Dot', he said, not turning round (so much for my intention to catch him unawares). 'Let me finish this stage and then you will have my full attention.' And he continued to add, drop by drop, chemicals from the pippette he was holding to the primeval soup he had bubbling in the flask over the bunsen.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Finally he turned to face me. 'I suppose you have come to berate me over the Keepsafe incident.'<font size=9>

<font size=14>No, that wasn't why I had come. While I might have been furious initially, the length of time (and my own busyness) since the building 'disappeared' had dissipated that anger. Besides, with Neolbah, and with the latest developments in the spheres' source world, I had seen that the Keepsafe was no longer needed. On the other hand, Quin, with his particular way of looking at things, definitely WAS needed.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I explained about Andy's work in restoring an area in the Cavern, and his offer of desk and shelf space for Quin's use.<font size=9>

<font size=14>For once, Quin listened carefully, obviously thinking through the implications. He has always been interested in my descriptions of the Cavern and the associated ages, and has even inspected the odd explorer-written age himself; but he has never really become part of the wider Uru community. He is very much a loner.<font size=9>

<font size=14>'Miss Dot,' he sighed, 'if I must... but it is essential that my work here takes priority.'<font size=9>

<font size=14>I agreed, and suggested that keeping a journal in more than one place might be a sensible precaution anyway, given our shared history. Worlds might come and go, but I wanted to make sure that information -- and stories -- might be preserved.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Showing a rare empathy, Quin nodded his own agreement -- and then immediately broke the mood by saying brusquely, 'Well, since you are here you might as well help me pack some things for moving.'<font size=9>

<font size=14>So the next two hours were spent carefully wrapping structures that were scattered round the base of the Tower, and placing them into large crates...


17 August 2010 -- Neolbah
Today I was back at Neolbah, showing Quin around. I suspect he was pleased when I left -- I could see he was itching to look more closely at some of the technology there. I hope he didn't fiddle with anything he shouldn't -- Andy readily admits that his repairs are a little dicey.


20 August 2010 -- Neolbah
Gah, sometimes I wish my face wasn't quite so expressive. I could see Andy was rather taken aback the other day. Still, I appreciated his sensitivity in giving me a bit of time to myself. It helped to clear my mind and sort out what needed doing.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Quin is flitting back and forth between Curiosity, Lost Pages and Neolbah. The crates I helped to pack on Saturday have been transported across to his new place on Lost Pages. Apparently they are some sort of engine he hopes to reassemble -- though whether he has all the bits is anyone's guess.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I did ask if he had anything to do with the door Andy had to free up. He ignored the question and started talking instead about his decision to revisit the ERC Age. I suppose that is answer enough.


22 August 2010 -- Lost Pages
Well, that was a weekend and a half! After a horrible day on Saturday, Sunday was quite a contrast.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I decided to visit Paislee and Quin, who were working in Lost Pages. Building work there is going well. Towards the top of the hill on the main island is a brick-built workshop, with a crane to lift cargo from any ship below, and equipment for handling heavy items installed within. Quin has already started playing with the engine parts I helped pack last week, and he has what looks like another experiment going with ... ah, not sure I should say about that just yet.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I don't know whether I have mentioned the details of the background to this particular project. But Quin's late Aunt Elspeth left him a sizable amount of money in her will to 'research and restore Lost Pages' -- lost pages being a metaphor for the worlds and ages and areas that may have been destroyed or misplaced, you might say, over time. Paislee's and Quin's home world of Devokan, now destroyed by its own sun, is a case in point.<font size=9>

<font size=14>All the building work going on at the moment is part of that project, which Quin has decided to call the Devokan Trust in memory of his old home. But the buildings are not the only component: there is also a need for personnel, and today Quin asked if I would consider playing a role in it. It will be challenging, but is a wonderful opportunity.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I have therefore resigned from the Guild of Maintainers, and am now officially part of the Devokan Trust, working as an independent freelance.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Nyn and the others in GoMa have been most helpful as ever, and everything has been sorted. Nyn has confirmed that a special area of the GoMa website is available for planning and communication even though the project is strictly independent of the guild. Andy says there is no problem in continuing to use Neolbah as an informal base, and that Quin too is welcome (even with his tendency to fiddle with the mechanisms).<font size=9>

<font size=14>So that is settled -- and it will be good to keep in touch with all my friends.


23 August 2010 -- Neolbah
On my return from the other world (Quin came with me, too), I found a note from Andy.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I could tell he was excited about something he had found -- but then that is Andy! He was also puzzled about the book down in the basement. It's certainly not one of mine, or of Quin's.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Anyway, while I went back to the office to complete some paperwork, Quin decided to investigate the one door that currently doesn't open, to see if he might get it working again -- he can't resist a challenge like that.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Just as I was carefully totting up a column of figures, an urgent shout of 'Miss Dot, come and see this!' broke my concentration.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Inwardly sighing, I pencil-marked the place I had got to and went out to see what was the matter.<font size=9>

<font size=14>'Do you see that, by the door?' Quin indicated the area of the wall he meant. 'I think there is some carving here, below the surface covering.'<font size=9>

<font size=14>Sure enough, there was some unevenness to the wall at that point. So, taking great care, we removed a little of the covering to reveal an inscription in D'ni, chiselled into the wall. Three words on three lines, the first and the third ending with the same letter, with a symmetrical-looking word on the middle line -- was it poetry?<font size=9>

<font size=14>At that point, I thought of Rehn: his patient and enthusiastic teaching of the D'ni language to the Uru diaspora in the other worlds we had settled in. Surely he would be able to translate it. I carefully copied down the letters, making sure to get the hooks and waves of that ancient alphabet in the correct proportion to each other.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I explained to Quin what I intended to do: that I would link back to my cottage in Winterfell Reverie, and from there contact Rehn. Quin decided he would prefer to stay a little longer in Neolbah -- I suspect the challenge of the locked door was too much of a pull.


24 August 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Rehn has come up trumps with a translation of the inscription: a phrase that turned out to be just what I needed to hear at that time. I was reminded too of the note attached to a package sent to Paislee by Quin's aunt Elspeth's solicitors back in late January, when we were evacuating Devokan.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Endings and beginnings... It's strange how such ideas resonate across aeons and civilisations and worlds...


26 August 2010 -- Neolbah
I finally caught up with Andy today. We had quite a bit to talk about.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Andy's news was very exciting, and what was even better is that he took me across to the new area he has found, just off the Great Shaft.<font size=9>

<font size=14>So while he continued working (and to avoid some of the resulting controlled mayhem) I ventured carefully down the spiral pathway -- Andy had warned me that the lift wasn't working at that particular level.<font size=9>

<font size=14>After several complete circuits, I came across another opening. This one was partly blocked by rubble, but there was enough room for me to squeeze through. It was another room, similar in size to the one Andy was working in, but it had an air of abandonment, as though it wasn't being used even before the disaster overtook the Cavern's original inhabitants. It made me think of an attic in one of those grand old country houses -- full of items needing repair or no longer needed.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Fairly close to the entrance, I spotted the pieces of an imager similar to the one in Neolbah. Now that was something we could do with. Since Andy had been able to repair the one already in Neolbah, he might well be able to get this one working again (even though it looked in far worse state).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Taking advantage of the acoustics of the Great Shaft, I shouted up to him to come and see what I had found. After a while he joined me, puffing slightly. Yes, he really does need to get into better shape; and no, he wasn't going to fit through that gap Wink Fortunately, the imager parts were just about visible from the entrance; I pointed them out and explained what I had in mind.<font size=9>

<font size=14>'Sounds good to me,' said Andy. 'We could use that for any KI shots of the new ages' -- for there is a plan to include in Neolbah first-hand descriptions of explorers' expeditions to some of the new ages, if we can. 'I guess Moe might come and give us a hand in shifting some of this rubble, and then getting the parts up to Neolbah. We will need help with this.'<font size=9>

<font size=14>Andy's friend Moe is a great character -- I liked him, even though I found his Aussie accent a little difficult to follow at times (I have the same problem with Glaswegian). 'No problem!' he said to Andy's request.<font size=9>

<font size=14>So now the imager parts are in Neolbah, awaiting repair and eventual connection.


30 August 2010 -- Curiosity
Yesterday I spent a little time in this other world, the one where Paislee has made her new home.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Having managed to prise Quin away from whatever it was he was doing in the tower laboratory, we went exploring. He did insist on taking along one of his portable monitors -- I think he might be checking out something in the local environment, though he didn't exactly say what -- that, or he needs an excuse to not work!<font size=9>

<font size=14>I opened up the map, and chose one of the nearby islands: Kamali.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We arrived eventually on a small sky island, a small distance apart from the main island. The view was wonderful -- I could see that even Quin was moved. <font size=9>

<font size=14>We managed to get across to the main island -- not as straightforward as you might think, for there was no obvious bridge.<font size=9>

<font size=14>After a while of quietly exploring the area, drinking in its sights and sounds, Quin started checking his monitor. I could see puzzlement in his face, so asked what was the matter.<font size=9>

<font size=14>"Miss Dot, this island -- it has exactly the same 'signature' as the sky island that broke free from the blighted Devokan Touchstone. Could it really be ...?"


4 September 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Over this last week, since that visit to Kamali, Quin has been in a strange mood -- more abstracted than usual. He has been back to Kamali once or twice, on his own, taking different types of equipment each time.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The rest of the time he seems to have spent in the small study Paislee has set up for him in the base of the tower at Curiosity, poring over his aunt's journals and other, ancient-looking, books. No mention of what he was researching, though.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Since there didn't seem much I could do to help, I linked back to the land of Winterfell Reverie, only to find a letter from Quin waiting for me. Undated, unfortunately -- I can't tell exactly when he wrote it -- and the postmark is too smudgy to decipher. But it confirms that Quin has abandoned his original plans to focus instead on this new world.
-----
Dear Miss Dot<font size=9>

<font size=14>So much has happened in this last month, it is difficult to know where to start.<font size=9>

<font size=14>One thing is clear: the plans I had a month ago have been turned on their head by events.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The landslip in Miss Paislee's new home world opened up an underwater entrance to more than just an ancient mine -- but to a future of remarkable machines powered by the fruit of that mine.<font size=9>

<font size=14>What is more, my monitoring equipment in the Lost Pages region of that world suggests that it too might hold similar veins beneath its otherwise unpromising surface.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Various 'coincidences' suggest that the sphere fluxes draw their power from these materials.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I need to focus. I will therefore dismantle the mechanism in the tower in Winterfell Reverie. Selenitica may disappear from that world. But by my reckoning, from tapping into the power available in the spheres' source world it should be possible to recreate a thousand Seleniticas, should I care to.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Winterfell has been (and is) a good place to be. But it is time for me to move on.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Your friend and colleague -- Quinquifid


8 September 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
With both Paislee and now Quin deciding to focus their attentions on the other world, it's become rather quiet here in Winterfell Reverie. Don't get me wrong -- the neighbours here are very pleasant, but I miss the relaxed chats Paislee and I used to enjoy at the end of the day in her rooms in the Devokan Inn, or in her seaside cottage on Reverie.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Perhaps it is time for me to close down operations here, and follow them.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I'll still have a base in Neolbah, where I can continue to work on various projects for the Devokan Trust. And I'm sure Paislee will put me up in one of the guest rooms while I sort out something more permanent over there.


11 September 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
Well, as Quin thought might happen, with the removal of the sphere mechanism, his small re-created Selenitica has now disappeared from the world of Winterfell Reverie. I have dismantled the rather rickety elevator system that previously enabled access to it, just in case anyone might decide to investigate and get dumped in mid air as a result.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I've emptied the cottage and put the furniture into storage. It's made me feel quite melancholic -- the area is lovely, but it is time to move on.


13 September 2010 -- Neolbah
I managed to catch up with Quin over the weekend. Although he has mostly been working in Lost Pages and Curiosity, he has spent some time in Neolbah getting his journal up to date.<font size=9>

<font size=14>He also managed to find the missing bit of the imager Andy, Moe and I had brought back to Neolbah from close by the new area Andy has been restoring -- apparently it was well buried under the rubble. Hopefully Andy will be able to get this second imager working now...


17 September -- Curiosity
Yesterday evening was a delight. Having completed the day's work, I linked over to Curiosity to see what Paislee and Quin had been up to.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Quin must have been working in Lost Pages, but soon after I arrived Paislee turned up. We walked up to her Hilltop House, and there she showed me a recent addition: a small, two-person blimp, docked near the bridge over the ravine close by the house.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Once we were safely seated in the blimp's basket, we took off and spent the next half hour or so sailing over Curiosity, enjoying the sights, catching up with each other's news.


18 September -- A&C Hotel, Minkarta
A new tenant was found very quickly for my cottage on Winterfell Reverie (well, it is located at a lovely spot), so it is just as well I had cleared out the furniture earlier.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I had previously managed to prise the keys to the Devokan Flyer from Quin -- he wasn't needing it in Lost Pages. So I have been using that as a base this last week, flying around, trying to think through the different directions and opportunities for the future.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Serendipity played a hand in clarifying the immediate future; yesterday I heard of an island becoming available close to the Age and Country Hotel on Minkarta, where so many Uru and Myst explorers have washed up over the years.<font size=9>

<font size=14>It was rather tricky landing the Flyer there, trying to avoid the cliffs and the trees, to say nothing of the hotel and market itself. But I finally achieved a reasonable touch-down, and have started to set up base there.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The proprietress, Jandai Writer, was most welcoming and helpful. And that evening I was able to welcome my old friends, Ivy, Ilf, Morgon and June, for their regular game of Spades -- albeit in irregular surroundings!


<pb>23 September -- Lost Pages
Having gotten everything mostly straightened out where the Flyer is docked, I decided it was time I caught up with events in the other world.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Paislee was away at the time. Quin, who for once was quite sociable, said she was working elsewhere.<font size=9>

<font size=14>He was obviously pleased with how things were going with the buildings on Lost Pages, reporting slow but steady progress. He took me over there to see for myself.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Once we had checked out the workshop building, he urged me to follow him down to what will be the laboratory.<font size=9>

<font size=14>In the centre of that room is the opening of a shaft, enclosed by safety railings I was pleased to see (Quin doesn't always remember to take care of health and safety issues). We took a basic elevator down the shaft, and followed the tunnel round, which eventually emerged on one of the smaller islands to the north.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Here we each clambered into an adaptation Quin has made of a basic hovercraft he found elsewhere in that world -- these adaptations make serviceable submersibles, as I was about to find out.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We plunged into the deeps, down to about 15 m below sea level. Visibility was adequate, and I followed Quin's submersible to what he was eager to show me: the start of a complex in the waters of Nocturne, to enable him to study the intriguing substances of this area in a more natural environment.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We inspected the ventilation shaft, and the various corridors leading from the main building, one of which leads to an observation area over a natural deposit of what look to be the same crystalline substances as were revealed by the landslip on Curiosity.


26 September -- Neolbah
During the time we spent looking around the complex being developed for the Devokan Trust in the regions of Lost Pages and Nocturne, Quin and I were discussing what might be needed in the future.<font size=9>

<font size=14>By its very nature, the mission of the Devokan Trust potentially spans many worlds, which has implications for location of infrastructure and localised bases.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Quin has taken a keen interest in the lost civilisation and ages of the D'ni since I told him about them, and sees it as a key area for future activities of the trust. So he asked if I knew of a central location that might be suitable to develop as a base for the trust.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I thought a little, then remembered the city of Ahra Pahts, discovered by Aloys some years ago. I said I would investigate possibilities there.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Accordingly, I checked out which areas were still available to be developed in the city, and linked in to check them out further. I was particularly attracted to the water district, thinking there were possible links with the investigations Quin is conducting. So, walking in an easterly direction from the main link-in point, I eventually arrived at Shell 415.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I booked the shell with Aloys and Robert the Rebuilder -- and now planning is underway!


5 October -- Neolbah
Yet another week has gone by...<font size=9>

<font size=14>I spent a bit of time in Neolbah. Quin came in with me for a while to use my laptop. While he has a rather splendid brass-and-mahogany portable (or "luggable") difference engine, he has so far not been able to connect it to any network that I know of, let alone the internet. So if he wants to research something on the web I have to move over.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Andy hasn't made any progress on getting the imager parts together. I think he is mostly splitting his time between Eder Tomahn -- the area he discovered about halfway down the Great Shaft -- and lending a hand to Marcus Wheeler's valiant efforts for the Guild of Maintainers.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I also took Quin across to see Shell 415 in Ahra Pahts. We linked down to Prin Pahts, the city's nexus area, and he was most taken by the crystals there, speculating whether they were functional or merely decorative. I reminded him of the crystals working in the Great Zero machine. Are they linked? Who knows?<font size=9>

<font size=14>Then the final plot of land on Winterfell Reverie needed to be seen to. The individual who took it on from me, Elspeth Sorrelwood, although a complete stranger, nevertheless reminded me of someone else. And although young-looking, her gait was that of an old woman -- stiff, somewhat ungainly. As Paislee might say, "I wonder..."


9 October -- Winterfell
Today I received a letter from Elspeth Sorrelwood:
-----
Dear Miss Macchi,
I trust that you and your colleagues are well. With regard to the land in Winterfell Reverie that I recently acquired from you, however, it seems that all is NOT well. I would like to discuss this with you, face to face, at the earliest opportunity.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Elspeth Sorrelwood
-----<font size=9>

<font size=14>For the journey to Winterfell, I decided to use one of the alternative transporters that Nalates has been testing out: the Kirstens system. It was just as well that I did, for it enabled me to see what had alarmed Mistress Sorrelwood.<font size=9>

<font size=14>She took me first to the elegant tower on the southwest corner of the island of Winterfell Reverie, and there quizzed me about modifications to the tower's foundations. "What is that gear mechanism? Why is it there?"<font size=9>

<font size=14>I tried to explain the experiments Quin had been conducting -- not an easy task, given that her dress would place Mistress Sorrelwood's eon around the late 1500s. To my surprise, she showed no puzzlement at what I said, but indicated understanding of some of the underlying concepts.<font size=9>

<font size=14>What surprised me even more is that she knew of Quinquifid. "You might say that I am an old family friend -- I knew his parents and grandparents -- oh, a lifetime ago, now!" This was coming from a women who looks half my own age!<font size=9>

<font size=14>"Now", she said, "I do not know whether those experiments might be behind what is happening here, but come outside and tell me what you see."<font size=9>

<font size=14>So we went outside, turning towards the sea. There was a stiff breeze, and the early evening air smelt fresh. Then I caught sight of what was worrying my new acquaintance: out of the corner of my eye I saw the flicker of darkness -- a deep black swallowing sea and sky.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Mistress Sorrelwood heard my intake of breath. "So you see it too? The darkness?" I nodded.<font size=9>

<font size=14>"At times I have seen the ghost of mountains too. Winterfell is, by its nature, a land on the edges of space-time -- and Reverie, here, is on the outer boundary. I do hope that Quinquifid's experiments with the seed spheres you describe have not destabilised matters."<font size=9>

<font size=14>And I thought back to when we needed to evacuate Devokan all those months ago -- how Quin had found mention of Winterfell in his aunt's journals, described in very similar terms. What was going on here?<font size=9>

<font size=14>Whatever it was, practically we needed to deal with the situation at hand. So I suggested that we contacted Winterfell's Seneschelf, Miss Serra, to see if it might be possible to move to a more central location, away from the anomaly.<font size=9>

<font size=14>To my relief and Mistress Sorrelwood's delight, an alternative plot was available on Winterfell Sanctuary, in the heart of the community. So all was agreed and set up.<font size=9>

<font size=14>As I turned to leave, Mistress Sorrelwood spoke: "Miss Macchi, I do hope that we might meet up again. Do come back and visit me when you have the time. For there are many things that we need to discuss."<font size=9>

<font size=14>Intrigued, I agreed.


11 October 2010 -- Winterfell Reverie
I briefly visited the south-west corner of Winterfell Reverie again today, and was pleased to find that Mr Weyland has acquired the land to add a stable complex to the Weyland estate.<font size=9>

<font size=14>But I hope that whatever it was that I saw with Mistress Sorrelwood won't spook the horses. They can be such temperamental creatures.


12 October 2010 -- Shell 415, Ahra Pahts
I'm pleased to report that work on Shell 415 in Ahra Pahts has begun in earnest. Ametist is supervising the building site operations. It looks like the builders come from her home nation Sweden, since they've set up a stoutly built log cabin to store their tools. Piles of sand are everywhere -- and shovels and a wheelbarrow.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Then D'Lanor is lined up to work on the area's infrastructure, to make sure everything works as it should do.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Ametist set up a private instance of the shell so that I could check out the floor tiles she was suggesting for Quin's and my rooms. She had chosen mottled dark brown tiles for Quin's workshop/laboratory -- eminently practical, I thought, given Quin's tendency to leave oil stains everywhere when he works on anything. The tiles for my office suite are light, modern, and attractive -- just perfect!


17 October 2010 -- Shell 415, Ahra Pahts
From a later visit to Shell 415, I can confirm that the builders have been hard at work. The resulting mud heaps are slippery, so wellingtons are recommended on site -- or a maintainers suit.


22 October 2010 -- Curiosity
It's been a worrying week. From Sunday, all communication was lost with Paislee's new home world -- no signals, nothing.<font size=9>

<font size=14>What is more, none of us could link in to check what was going on. The transporter systems simply came up with 'Destination unavailable' whenever we tried.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Listening to various Twitter streams helped -- pioneer explorers of that world were explaining what they understood was happening. They seemed calm.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Then, on Tuesday, word came out that contact had been re-established. It seems the world had shifted to a slightly different place in the multiverse, so that we had to adjust our transporters to a new set of coordinates.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Of course, we linked in straight away to check whether there was any damage. Initially linking between areas was hit-and-miss, with many lands still being unreachable. But one by one they reappeared on the live world map.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I'm relieved to say that all of the islands in our corner of the world have survived: Tallis, Curiosity, Nalands, kamali, Lost Pages and all the neighbouring lands are accessible once more.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Cross-communication links between worlds are still not completely restored, but being able to link in directly helps to ease any concern.


27 October -- Shell 415, then Deepwater
After I received ametist's latest report about Shell 415, I thought it would be an idea to see if we could talk to Quin together. I suspected that he might be working in Curiosity or Lost Pages, so suggested we try there.<font size=9>

<font size=14>This was a new adventure for ametist -- I don't think she had been to the transported islands before, because of her busy workload on the Uru Educational Ages and other projects.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We finally managed to get to the same place (not easy, for there were still some lingering problems after the upheavals earlier in the week), and decided to link to Curiosity first.<font size=9>

<font size=14>No sign of Quin, or of Paislee.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We went across to Waysmeet (the tree village) and from there to Deepwater, that mysterious place of ancient ritual. I could see ametist was taken with the islands. The pictures on the imager in Neolbah do not do them justice -- you really do need to visit them in person.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The temple on Deepwater intrigued her, especially the blue plasma sphere within its rotating gold cage. I explained how Quin and Nalates had conjectured that such spheres might be the source of what enabled the transfer across of elements of the old Devokan to this new world.<font size=9>

<font size=14>She went on to speculate whether it might be possible to generate a similar sphere within Shell 415. That, I think, we will need to get Quin involved with -- and check with D'Lanor first, who is overseeing the shell infrastructure development. We do not want to cause any linking mishaps in Ahra Pahts.


3 November -- Winterfell Sanctuary
While Mistress Sorrelwood in person seems as elusive as ever, when I checked her house yesterday I found a letter addressed to me on her desk.
-----
My dear Miss Macchi,
I fear that I might have caused you some inconvenience with my sudden disappearance. There were matters I needed to attend to -- elsewhere, shall we say? Elsewhen too, if that is a term I might employ.<font size=9>

<font size=14>While a modicum of stability has been achieved, my presence is still needed there. Hence this letter.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I have suspected from our first conversation that you sensed that my past is somehow entangled with your own and that of your friends. That is something I had hoped for -- just as I had hoped that Quinquifid would act on the hints I left in my journals.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I should explain: I am Elspeth Sorrelwood of the past; I am also from a distant future -- and Devokan is my home.<font size=9>

<font size=14>That statement will probably surprise you given the fact that you witnessed Devokan's destruction in its sun's fiery embrace. But, as time flows on and events unfold, you and your friends will understand more.<font size=9>

<font size=14> The foundation I charged Quinquifid to set up under the terms of my will -- "To research and restore what was lost" -- is key. Your companions from the various worlds are also key: the different skills and understandings each brings will make possible the restoration, not just of Devokan, but of other worlds and ages too.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Of immediate concern is the following: You need to find the Celestial Clock that was in the Sphere of Lost Pages over the old Devokan. Once you find it, install in a place where time is less chaotic than here in Winterfell. I am sure you will be able to find a suitable home for it.<font size=9>

<font size=14>In the other world, you will discover that the recent instability has resulted in the formation of a new island: Devokan Starfyre. Its time and place is far from the islands you know -- those of Curiosity, Deepwater, Tallis, Nalands, Lost Pages, ... This is deliberate. I see that Mr Mahogany has started work there -- his role in this is vital.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Finally, while I am away, I would like you to make full use of my house and land here in Winterfell Sanctuary. It is a joy to me, as I trust it will be to you.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Be assured, Miss Macchi, you and your companions are much in my thoughts.<font size=9>

<font size=14>Sincerely,
Elspeth Sorrelwood
-----<font size=9>

<font size=14>Oh my!


7 November 2010 -- Shell 415, Ahra Pahts
After that intriguing letter, the weekend was spent on more mundane matters.<font size=9>

<font size=14>D'Lanor and ametist let me know that Phase 1 of the building of Shell 415 was complete, and it was time for this stage of the work to be signed off. So, on Saturday, we met up in the shell, the first time all of us were there together. Dustin joined us too a little later.<font size=9>

<font size=14>We spent some time discussing the next stage, which we hope to complete by the end of the year. By the end of Phase 2 I should have a properly lit office (Neolbah is very nice, but the light is not good for my poor eyes, especially when composing journal entries).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Quin is to have a laboratory/workshop in the opposite corner of the shell. I hope we won't get complaints from the neighbours once it is up and running.<font size=9>

<font size=14>That reminds me: I must check with ametist whether the builders are taking care not to disturb others when working. D'Lanor noticed that their radio-cassette could be heard in neighbouring shells -- we shall have to watch that.


10 November 2010 -- Lost Pages
After the weekend's focus on Shell 415 and other matters directly related to Uru, it was time to look once again at the letter left for me by Elspeth Sorrelwood. Accordingly, I decided to take it across to Lost Pages and show it to Quin, to find out what he thought.After the weekend's focus on Shell 415 and other matters directly related to Uru, it was time to look once again at the letter left for me by Elspeth Sorrelwood. Accordingly, I decided to take it across to Lost Pages and show it to Quin, to find out what he thought.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I was hoping that the contents of the letter might sufficiently intrigue him to overcome any potential upset. Although outwardly Quin often seems cold and without emotion, his writing at times betrays a strong underlying passion for his science -- and, surprisingly, for the welfare of his friends.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I linked in just as he was carefully re-positioning a small golden 'cage' around a mini-sphere. "What's that?" I asked.<font size=9>

<font size=14>"Ah, I had left this on the desk at Neolbah for you to see. Unfortunately, Mr Legate spotted it, decided to investigate and somehow ended up here. So for his own and others' safety I have brought it back. I should have known better not to take it over there, given the proclivities of some of your colleagues never to leave well alone."<font size=9>

<font size=14>I raised my eyebrows at this, given Quin's own well-known tendencies in that area (and the fact that he still will not call Andy "Andy", even though why he should do so has been explained on numerous occasions). However, this wasn't the focus of my visit, so I took out the letter, unfolded it and placed it on the workbench.<font size=9>

<font size=14>"This was left for me in the house at Skysong, on Winterfell Sanctuary," I explained. "Read it. See what you make of it."<font size=9>

<font size=14>I watched his face as he read. There was no obvious reaction apart from a slight wrinkling of the brow. "The writing looks to be very similar to that of my aunt's in her earliest journals."<font size=9>

<font size=14>He reached for a magnifying glass to inspect the letter more closely. "Yes, the long-s letterforms match those in my aunt's journals." I was hoping at that point I might catch a glimpse of these fabled books (Quin has been very careful to keep them out of sight and under lock and key). Unfortunately, this was not to be.<font size=9>

<font size=14>"Have you made a copy of the contents of this letter?" he asked. I nodded, and Quin continued: "I would like to keep this original and study it further. Now, I trust you will excuse me, but I have work to do..." And with that, he picked up the letter, and abruptly linked out.


13 November 2010 -- Winterfell
I've not seen Quin since he linked out mid-conversation.<font size=9>

<font size=14>There have been further instabilities around Lost Pages and Curiosity this week -- and judging by Quin's latest note in the log book in Shell 415, he was aware they were coming.<font size=9>

<font size=14>The note said he was going to Minkarta, staying there while he conducted some library research; at a guess he was intending to use the Age and Country Hotel as a base. If he hadn't rudely linked out when he did, I could have warned him that the hotel was facing demolition.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I finally tracked him down via Mr Whitfield, a mutual friend and inhabitant of Winterfell. Quin had contacted him and asked if he might stay in his guest house for a few days -- it sounds like he was most put out about the hotel. Fortunately, Mr Whitfield had agreed, and made Quin welcome. So that's one mystery solved.


16 November 2010 -- Winterfell
That man! I needed to contact Quin urgently today about a Trust matter so travelled down to Mr Whitfield's guest house in Winterfell, only to find that Quin's bags and belongings were no longer in evidence -- and nor was Quin!<font size=9>

<font size=14>Where has he gone now? And, what is more to the point, what is he up to?


17 November 2010 -- Shell 415, Ahra Pahts
Still no sign of Quin, but when I checked on progress in Shell 415, there was a note in his logbook:
-----
November 16
Library research most fruitful; possible new avenue to explore. Am eager to put new-found knowledge to use practically. Left note of apology to Mr Whitfield. I trust he will let Miss Dot know.
-----<font size=9>

<font size=14>Mr Whitfield had let me know, in fact, and I appreciated his taking time out of his busy schedule to tell me about Quin's departure. He also mentioned a visit by Elspeth Sorrelwood, something that surprised me greatly given all the attempts I have made to contact her. It seems she had concerns about what Quin might be doing, and had asked that Mr Whitfield might look out for him.


18 November 2010 -- Neolbah
I bumped into Andy Legate in Neolbah (he was fixing the second imager).<font size=9>

<font size=14>Dear, generous Andy has lent Quin the descriptive book for Serene so he could study it further.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I hope against hope that Quin understood Andy's warnings to take care of it -- that if it were harmed or damaged Serene would be gone forever. But knowing Quin, merely studying the book will not be enough. He will try to write changes into it, to see what happens.


22 November 2010 -- Neolbah
Ametist mentioned seeing Quin when she was checking progress in Shell 415. He hadn't said anything, though -- just walked around the area, looking and touching the walls -- and then suddenly linked out.<font size=9>

<font size=14>I went to the shell to check things for myself. Seeing what Quin had written in the logbook confirmed my worse fears. He has overwritten parts of Serene's descriptive book.]]></translation>

I took a small makeshift boat, and decided to head for a spot in the wall of the cavern. I found a small cave where I landed and wandered around, lost, for a day or two, when I stumbled upon a bigger cave with a walkway. As I made my way down it, when I got to a certain point, a gate came crashing down and I have not been able to get it opened back up. This walkway led to the Atrium of Neolbah. Fortunately, there was a Nexus linking pedestal there with a book going to the Nexus and, by using it, I was able to have a link to this place included in my KI.


July 5th
Finally got the what I call "Maintenance" door open! Then had yet more D'ni tech to face... sigh...

Good news is that I got it working... er... um... in a "This Is Really Jury-Rigged" sort of way, heh.

Problem is, I had to reset the door code... and if you enter the wrong one, the power resets on it! Just can't figure it out...

Ah well.

I did remember to leave a note to Dot on her desk down there with the code. So she and any other visitor should be okay.

Now I've got to get back to the surface and the other project that I'm working on...

Now where did I leave my coffee cup???


August 18th
Linked back in to Neolbah today. Found one of the doors acting up. Swift kick or two seemed to fix it. :shrug:

I wandered over to the door that I've not had time to get working yet. I thought I could hear something. I pressed my ear against the door. Was that a dripping noise I heard? Hard to tell with the water splashing in the fountain and the noise from the imager going on.

I was walking over to my table when Dot linked in. Scared me to death! All these years and I'm still not used to someone suddenly popping into existence in front of me like that! Gah!

The look on Dot's face was very clear to me: "I'm really ticked off right now and want to be alone!" However, the look changed quickly into a smile and a wave of hello when she saw me.

Right! I'm glad it wasn't ME that had ticked her off so bad! Whew!

I could tell she wanted to be alone though, and I needed to get going anyways. I've got a new area that I've been looking into that's in the Great Shaft. So giving excuses, and waving goodbye, I quickly used my Relto book to leave. I knew I'd be back later.



August 23rd
Today I rushed back to Neolbah to see if Dot was there. I wanted to tell her what I and my friend Moe found up in the Great Shaft!

Moe is from Down Under, in Cairns, Australia. I met him a ways back while playing an online game. We've become fast friends and I had told him all about the Cavern and the D'ni.

Moe was fascinated with what I had described to him. His wife Meg (short for Megumi) and he flew to the States to visit me and Tracey. Of course with him visiting, I just could not resist dragging him down here!

To make a long story short (and by the way, Moe stands at about 6 foot 8 inches... I forgot he'd need a hard hat. He spent a lot of time yelling "OW!" down here), I decided to take Moe down the Great Shaft.

The look of wonder on his face was worth every gripe from him about his sore feet, which he promptly forgot about when he looked down the shaft from the top! Heh.

We made our way down using the series of elevators and walking paths until we got about half way. I'd heard there was a Rest Room right about here (there are several, but this one took some getting to).

Once in the Rest Room, I pointed, while bent over breathing hard (I've GOT to lose some weight!). Moe looked over and said, "What? It's just another bloody room that... Look... the... that door back there is open!"

Still catching my breath, I stood upright and nodded my head. Yep, the door was open on this one!

We moved in and to my astonishment, it looked like some sort of pub or bar! There was a place for people to sit, and even what looked like a small kitchen!

I could tell Moe was getting aggravated with me, as I kept smacking his huge hands yelling, "Touch nothing!"

Further investigation revealed what looked like living quarters. That's when I found a book! That is also when Moe got another smack to his hand. I remember him looking at me confused saying "Look, mate, it's just a book! How is touching it going to--"

He broke off as I was waving my Relto book under his nose. "Just a book?" I looked at him with raised eyebrows. "So what happens if you open it up and touch it? Nothing? Or maybe a sudden lurching feeling, and existing... where? A tropical island? A dark pit? A place whose atmosphere is poison to us? Do you want to find out the hard way?"

Moe grinned sheepishly at me (well, as sheepish as a man his size can look), and shrugged. "Sorry, mate. I'm still new to all this."

I held up my finger and drew a pen out of my pocket, one that I had been using to take notes. I gently lifted the cover of the book over, and saw simply D'ni writing. No linking panel.

"It's safe," I told Moe. "But it's a good find! It might tell us about this place."

"You can read that chicken scratch?" Moe asked me with eyebrows raised (he has a big forehead, so this is really a sight to see, heh).

"No," I replied. "But I know people that can."

I pulled a large bag from my backpack and slipped the book into it. Then placed it back in my pack.

It was time to go then. I knew I would be back, but for now I had other places to take Moe.

I left Moe in the good hands of Steve at the Ferry Terminal in Ae'gura. I wanted to get back to Neolbah and tell Dot what I had found. When I left them, they were busy discussing Australian beer, or "Aussie Beer" as Moe calls it.

I shook my head. Here he was 3 miles down underground in the ruins of a 10,000 year old civilization, and they were going to discuss beer...

Dot wasn't in Neolbah. Felt like I had just missed her. Sighing, I was about to link out when I thought I heard something. It was from the elevator shaft. The elevator itself was not present.

I walked over and called it up to me, and rode it down to the basement. Walking to the end of the tunnel, I didn't see anyone.

I stared at the two valves that are down there. I keep thinking they do more than just maybe shut off the fountain. That's when my eye caught the book lying on a crate!

Who in the world left this here? When did this happen? I need to get with Dot.



October 30th
Head hurts... pounding really. All the linking I've done, and I've never had a headache like this before... did I link?

I don't know where I'm at. Worse. My Relto book isn't on me either.

Thinking... I was in Eder Tomahn, examining one of the elevator levers. They're stuck, but I think I can free one up.

I left and linked to Neolbah where I had left some of my tools. I don't remember what happened next. I remember being IN Neolbah, but... the next memory is me opening my eyes here. Wherever 'here' is.

I can't place it. I've never seen this place...

But someone has been here, I think...

Yes. I think I need to explore... maybe I can learn something...


November 17th
You know, you'd think I'd have learned after all these years of exploring the Cavern here underground, and whole alternate worlds, to NOT touch something when I don't know what it is!

My trip to this place called "Nocturne" was very interesting (if unexpected). I saw many new things before Quin found me wandering around.

I took a couple of weeks and took in the sights until Quin brought me back home. But that's another story.

During the time I was there with Quin, he asked me about Descriptive Books and Linking Books. Their differences, and purposes.

I took him to my Relto and showed him some of the Descriptive Books that I had found, plus those that I had created while dabbling in the Art.

Quin was quite insistent about visiting some of these places (well, as "insistent" as Quin gets, which amounts to a single raised eyebrow and a "I would very much like to see this place, Mr. Legate.").

So I took him to Zephyr Cove, Camp Bravo and ended with Serene.

Serene seemed to draw a strange expression across Quin's face. I've seen wonder, awe and even surprise on people's faces when they visit Serene, but never an expression of... puzzlement. Something about Serene seemed to puzzle Quin. He spent a lot of time walking around, looking and exploring every inch of it.

Later, back at my Relto, Quin asked if he might take a look at my Descriptive Book for Serene. I handed it over to him, and caught the faintest look of delight on his face. If I had blinked, I would have missed it.

I asked him to look after it, making him understand that if it were harmed or damaged that Serene would be gone forever.

Nodding in understanding, he left and I headed back home to my family. Thanksgiving is coming up and I've got turkeys to cook!



November 26th
Quiet rage.

Disbelief.

Shock.

These are some of the things I'm feeling as I sit here on a rock, looking out over the ocean here at Deepwater.

Serene. It's gone. At least the Serene that I created a link to is gone. What's there now is... well, not Serene, and yet it is Serene.

I should have seen this coming. I should have been able to keep it from happening...

Several days ago, I decided to link to Serene. The snow and wind always put me in the holiday mood, and with Thanksgiving approaching, it felt like it was just the ticket.

To my shock and horror, my linking book was not working. The linking panel no longer showed Serene, but instead was a grey swirl and smoke. The link had been severed. How?

I immediately thought of Quin and the fact that I had given him the Descriptive Book to Serene for study. My thoughts turned to concern for his safety. Had something happened to him while he had the book?

I started linking to all the places I could think of where he might be. When I got to Neolbah, I found a note from Dot sitting on her desk.

When I read that note, my feelings of concern for Quin vanished. Instead, I went ice cold with rage.

I linked to Shell 415 in Ahra Pahts where I found D'Lanor and Ametist working hard. As I approached them, I guess they could tell how upset I was. D'Lanor's face went blank except for the quick blinking of his eyes. Ametist had started to smile at me, but the smile shattered and I don't think I've seen her go that pale before.

I stopped in front of them and asked quietly, "Where's Quin?"

Ametist's eyes got even wider at the tone of my voice. "I'm not sure, Andy," she replied. She then pointed towards a hedge, "But he was here earlier. He left that linking book to Serene over there."

I walked over to the book and picked it up. Opening it showed a working linking panel to Serene... but yet, not quite Serene.

Turning towards D'Lanor and Ametist, my hand hovered over the linking panel. My eyes met theirs. D'Lanor's mouth hardened to a straight line, and his head gave a slight nod.

My hand slapped down onto the linking panel and I faded away from Shell 415.

I'd seen understanding in D'Lanor's eyes. He knew Quin had done something unforgivable.

Quin had destroyed an Age. 

------------------------------
It was Serene, but not Serene.

I stood there, I don't know how long. Numb, but not from the cold. Numb with shock, anger and, strangely, wonder all at the same time.

The path was made of different stone. There were more trees. Even the snow looked different to my eyes.

Finally I slowly turned around to the Nexus book stand. It was still there, and even looked the same. An Age Anchor? I'd never thought about it. But Anchor or not, the linking book to the Nexus was gone.

I moved slowly down the path, and saw a temple. There was red light coming from it. I stopped again.

I knew that design. I'd seen it in pictures. It was from some of the places Quin had been.

Quin. My hands curled into fists on their own. How could he do this? How could he just disregard everything I'd said about Descriptive Books?

I went no further, but quickly linked back to my Relto. My feet went out from under me and I sat down hard on the ground. I began to shake with rage. The temper I'd gotten from my mother, that ugly beast that I always keep chained up and caged. It raged against the bars of its cage. Howling to get out. It would not stay locked up.

So be it. I was alone. I let it out.

Some time later, I came to my senses, lying on my side, breathing hard and feeling exhausted. My vision was blurry from tears. I quickly sat up and wiped them from my eyes.

The beast was back in its cage. Locked up where it would stay. Still seething, but under control now.

I got on my feet and walked to my Relto hut.

It was time to confront Quin.

------------------------------------------------

I found Quin in Neolbah. He was in Dot's office, with Dot. I could see the concern on her face, yet Quin's expression was one of confusion.

I began to speak, addressing Quin. I kept my voice low, steady but ice cold.

I dressed Quin down. Describing how irresponsible his actions had been. How he'd had no right to tamper with an Age that was not of his creation. That never again would I trust him with anything so precious.

Quin's eyes widened only briefly, but his expression quickly turned hard. Instead of regret, remorse, or guilt, he instead looked at me with his own anger, and what looked like disgust.

When I was done speaking, he simply linked out.

The office remained quiet for a few minutes, then Dot spoke.

"Andy, I know how angry you must be. Please realize that Quin in many ways can be like a child. A child who has lost a whole world and saw a way to bring at least part of it back. Can you understand that?"

I looked over at Dot. "Yes, I can understand it. You are right in that he's like a child. And like a child, who wishes so hard to bring something back, he had no thought of the fact he was going to cause the exact same loss on me. Maybe you can explain that to him sometime. That while he may have brought something he lost back, he's inflicted the exact same loss that he suffered upon me."

I shook my head sadly. "Sorry, Dot. I've got to be alone for a while."

And with that, I linked out. Maybe Deepwater could make me feel better.]]></translation>

The
Devokan
Trust

<font size=14>To research and restore 
what was lost



Logbook

<pb><font size=11 face=Courier><p align=left>July 29
Letter from solicitors reminding of obligation to set up research foundation under terms of the late Elspeth Sorrelwood's will "to research and restore what was lost".


August 2
Architects commissioned to design and build complex of laboratories and workshops on island of Lost Pages in the spheres' source world. Considering what to name the trust. 

Laboratory work in the meantime to be undertaken in the Tower on Curiosity.


August 4
Delegated supervision of construction of research complex on Lost Pages and Nocturne to Paislee Myrtle.


August 10
Finally decided on a name for the organisation: The Devokan Trust.


August 14
Basic construction of workshop on Lost Pages now complete. Laboratory currently being constructed; will include underwater area for observation. 


August 17
Set up temporary base in D'ni Cavern, in Neolbah -- room kindly loaned by Andy Legate, who is restoring the area.


August 22
Dot Macchi (DM) joined the trust on a freelance basis. 


September 5
Commissioned DM to set up HQ/offices for the trust in other worlds.


September 10
Good progress with underwater complex on Lost Pages and Nocturne. Laboratory building complete, but not yet furnished.


September 15
Small island near the Age and Country Hotel, Minkarta, acquired for the trust's use. DM is using the Devokan Flyer as a temporary base.


September 25
DM reported that she has booked Shell 415 in the water district of Ahra Pahts with Aloys and Robert the Rebuilder. She is currently setting up teams to design and build the shell: ametist will supervise the building work, and D'Lanor the infrastructure.


October 3
Visited Ahra Pahts and Shell 415 with DM. Canals in water district are frozen -- consider heating methods to enable necessary liquid water in shell eventually. Crystals in Prin Pahts will bear further investigation -- possible links with those found on Curiosity and more recently on Lost Pages?


October 8
Builders started work on Shell 415 under ametist's supervision. 


October 12
DM reported progress on Shell 415: foundations marked out, building sand and various tile samples delivered, tool and builders' sheds erected. 


October 17
Dot Macchi reports that foundations for Shell 415 dug. NB wear suitable protective clothing (hard hats; workboots) -- mud is slippery.


October 18
Severe instability around Curiosity and Lost Pages regions rendered inter- and intra-world communication nigh-on impossible. Links attempted to other regions failed. By-product of current experiment? Or inherent property of this part of the multiverse? (Note to self: research space-time inhomogeneities when next able to access libraries from Winterfell or Minkarta -- stay at hotel?)


October 20
Communications and links re-established with outside world. Pity. Was able to concentrate on work with no interruption while the outage lasted.


October 23
Received Report on Phase 1 from ametist:
-------
No problems so far, we have nearly completed the tiled floors of both apartments, now awaiting material for phase 2, the buildings. We've got just one stack of building stones transported into the shell so we have to wait for more to come; expected next week.

It's a nice place to work in, very calm, not many visitors, fresh air and interesting other shells to visit during breaks.
-------


October 27
Visited Neolbah. Andy Legate still not reassembled imager despite my having found vital missing piece. Current trials on mini spheres are interesting. Left one on desk in Neolbah for DM to see.


October 28
Note from DM. She and ametist visited Curiosity, Waysmeet and Deepwater yesterday, looking for me. Suggestion/speculation from ametist: generate sphere in Shell 415 similar to one in Deepwater temple? Might be possible -- would need to coordinate efforts with D'Lanor (need power/water in shell).


October 31
Found Mr Legate wandering around Lost Pages in severely dazed state. Unexpected link caused by mini sphere in Neolbah? Removed it, just in case.


November 1
Fascinating discussion with Mr Legate re Descriptive and Linking Books -- their differences and purposes. Must see if I can get sight of one.


November 5
Visited Shell 415 to check progress of Phase 1. Sign-off should be possible over next few days.


November 7
DM reported on-site meeting with shell developers ametist and D'Lanor on 6 November. Discussion of next phase. Phase 1 sign-off agreed and implemented with assistance from Dustin and Robert the Rebuilder.


November 9
DM turned up at Lost Pages. Showed me peculiar letter purportedly from my late aunt. Looks like her handwriting -- compared it with her journals. Bizarre.


November 10
Signs that a further period of instability might be developing in Lost Pages and Curiosity. Decided to use this as opportunity for research further afield, first into Descriptive/Linking Books, then library research re space-time inhomogeneities (somewhat ironic).


November 11
Mr Legate most obliging: invited me to his "Relto" and showed me some Descriptive Books, then took me to visit them. Serene -- reminds me strongly of Kamali and of Skysong. Different times, places, worlds, yet a similar basic underlying signature... 

Why, and how? 


November 12
I have the Descriptive Book for Serene! A wonderful opportunity! Now for the necessary library research -- off to Minkarta. 


November 13
Plans of staying in Age and Country Hotel on Minkarta were frustrated: the hotel is scheduled for demolition. Contacted Mr Whitfield in Winterfell to ask if I may stay in his private guest-house for a few days; he kindly agreed.


November 16
Library research most fruitful; possible new avenue to explore, combined with information from Mr Legate and previous results of study of Kamali. Am eager to put new-found knowledge to use practically. Left note of apology to Mr Whitfield. I trust he will let DM know.


November 17
Systematically adding elements from Kamali's signature into the Descriptive Book for Serene. Results not always what I expect. Need to be careful -- all too easy to cause instability. 


November 19
Modified small temple structure in Serene so that its roof will act as "cage" for a Devokan sphere. Seems appropriate to try to capture red type -- associated with Skysong's destruction but Kamali's creation. 


November 20
Much to my relief, the experiment has worked, and remarkably Serene is still stable. 


November 21
Visited Shell 415 to check on progress (all to plan, looking good); ametist was working there. Nodded a greeting, then linked out. 


November 22
Where did I put that Linking Book to Serene?! Did I leave it in Shell 415?


November 27
The instabilities continue in the spheres' source world. The account I have left in Serene of an earlier episode will have to suffice. I have done what I could. I can do no more.

5 December 2010
With Quin gone missing for over a week, I have temporarily taken charge of Trust matters.

Dot Macchi


<pb><font size=11 face=Courier color=221166>9 December 2010 -- DM (QO awol)
Shell 415 progress report: Discussion with D'Lanor and ametist on how to secure linking and descriptive books. Need secure book room, with keypad-controlled access. D'Lanor to develop keypad.


13 December 2010 -- DM
Winterfell: Land acquired on Winterfell Reverie for Trust base -- named it Devokan Dusklight.


23 December 2010 -- DM
Shell 415: DM's apartment finished. Linking books stored in a secure basement area underneath apartment; accessed by typing code on keypad outside locked bookroom. Delivery mechanism implemented and tested using temporary codes for current linking books: Neolbah and Serene. 


27 December 2010 -- DM
Shell 415: Agreed with D'Lanor and ametist on coding scheme for the linking book access keypad. 

Each linking book will have a six-button code, three buttons in each column. 

For Neolbah, it is simply the bottom three buttons of each column (nice and easy to remember).

Given the previous problems with Serene, its code is not quite so obvious. But anyone who can positively remember the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything should be able to link there without too much difficulty.


30 December 2010 -- DM
Shell 415: Latest Security Ombudsman inspection highlighted no problems -- construction may continue. 


31 December 2010 -- DM
Trust news: Shenn and Leah agreed to act as consultants to the Devokan Trust. Spheres' source world to be called "Restoration". Trust base island on Restoration to be renamed "Touchstone" (was "Lost Pages").





<font size=18 face=Atrus color=000000><p align=left>I am grateful to Ms Macchi for her cover during my recent unscheduled sabbatical. However, it is time to take up the reins once again for Trust matters.

Quinquifid Oddenfen

<pb><font size=11 face=Courier>JANUARY 2011

January 5
Restoration: New island appeared to west of Waysmeet. Documentary evidence suggest it is Skysong, albeit from an earlier time, used by Elspeth Sorrelwood as base.


January 15
Trust news: ametist invited to work for the Trust as an independent freelance, along same lines as DM.


January 17
Trust news: New forum set up for project planning and discussion -- http://forum.devokan.org/


January 26
Restoration: M. Shenn and and Mlle Leah report progress with their project area named Tao. M. Shenn commented that time is not stable on Tao; QO to observe and investigate.


January 29
Shell 415: With Restoration inaccessible once more, QO investigating crystals in Prin Pahts. 

Possible to use with samples from Touchstone to generate sphere in 3rd area of shell? (See logbook entry for October 28.)


<pb>FEBRUARY 2011

February 14
Shell 415: Setting up experiment in 3rd area. When activated, crystals have distinctive "hum" and colour. Web research -- links with Newton's colour wheel? 


February 17
Shell 415: Found similar diagram in one of Elspeth's old journals. Includes strange symbols -- showed them to DM, who suggests they may be associated with the lost world of Riven. Research continues.


February 18
Shell 415: With ametist's and D'Lanor's expert assistance, have installed experiment in 3rd area: pool, crystals, cage mechanism, control panel. 

Theory suggests that sphere is generated by particular combination of three activated crystals -- possibly through resonance and interference patterns of sound and electromagnetic waves. But which crystals?


February 21
Shell 415: Briefed D'Lanor and ametist on final details to experiment. D'Lanor suggested replacing water in pool with oil to smooth cage rotation. 

Winterfell: DM to set up "Time Vault" to house Celestial Clock -- last seen in "Lost Pages" sphere on the original Devokan. Possible regulatory function? Urgently required, given current events on Tallis and Tao.


February 26
Shell 415: Eureka! Found a combination that works -- three crystals, as surmised.

The sphere that appeared spawned a link to a new age. From what I learned earlier from Mr Legate, I was able to set up a linking book which is now in the secure linking book storage area. 

As an aide memoire, the bookroom keypad access code is based on the crystals' activation numbers, as gleaned from Elspeth's journals. 


February 28
Shell 415: The diagram from Elspeth's journal with the crystals' activation numbers has disappeared. It must be somewhere in the shell... 

<pb>MARCH 2011

March 3
Winterfell: Time Vault and Celestial Clock installed; area portal system updated. Ms Dot to contact M Shenn re possible new experiment.


March 8
Winterfell: "Time Vortex" (M Shenn's experiment) now installed.]]></translation>

Dot's Journal

<font size=14>From 
December 2010 




<pb><font size=11 face=Courier color=000000>:::  DECEMBER 2010  :::

<p align=left>2 Dec 2010
Quin is missing. I've not seen him since that disastrous encounter with Andy. But the seasons turn, and life goes on...

Winter has returned to Winterfell. The snowy landscape looks so peaceful in this twilight realm.

I have contacted Mr Whitfield to let him know what has happened with regard to Quin. I suspect that Quin is more likely to get in touch with him at the moment, since I was already trying to gently explain the problems with changing Serene's descriptive book to Quin before Andy confronted him so powerfully. Quin was proud of what he felt he had achieved and could not see what the difficulty was.


5 Dec 2010
Yesterday the Security Ombudsman delivered his inspection report on Shell 415. 

I was grateful to ametist for dealing with the Ombudsman -- handling bureaucracy has never been my forte.

Her translation of the report was interesting. I went to check myself, and saw the slight subsidence around the shell entrance, where the paving slabs were indeed uneven and a slight moisture was evident within the cracks.

Since most of the water in Ahra Pahts seems frozen, the presence of liquid water beneath our shell is potentially very useful, especially for the planned feature in the far area opposite the entrance.

<pb>Quin is still missing. When I last linked to the spheres' source world, it was obvious that the instabilities he had noted were continuing. Mat Mahogany was there. He said that using the technology available to him, he had moved his home island of Tallis and the lovely Kamali region across to a parallel world temporarily for safety. He mentioned seeing Quin one day, but Quin was preoccupied and hadn't returned his greeting.

Later: I've just linked there again. Waysmeet and Deepwater have vanished. Only Paislee's island of Curiosity is there. What is going on?

In Quin's continued absence, I'd better assume responsibility for the Devokan Trust.


9 Dec 2010
Work on Shell 415 is continuing. Ametist has installed warning signs -- although some are in Swedish, the graphics get across the message to the rest of us. Scaffolding is being used for the first time as the builders prepare to roof my apartment.

D'Lanor, ametist and I have been discussing how to secure linking and descriptive books in order to prevent the problems that happened with Serene. We've agreed that in my apartment there will be a secure book room, with keypad-controlled access. D'Lanor is currently developing the control panel mechanism -- his initial prototypes work very well indeed.


10 Dec 2010
As I suspected he might do, Quin has turned up at Mr Whitfield's guest rooms in Winterfell. Mr Whitfield has just let me know. 


13 Dec 2010
A strategic plot of land has become available on Winterfell Reverie, so I snapped it up. 

I contacted Paislee. She was coping well with the instability over in the spheres' source world, and though her island of Curiosity was now isolated and mostly submerged, she has managed to move key structures on to higher ground out of the reach of the waves.

We discussed what we might do, and agreed that the place we both missed most from our old Devokan home was the Inn, a lovely old carriage house. So, we set to, and on the newly acquired plot in Winterfell Reverie that handsome structure now stands.

Paislee needed to link back to Curiosity -- she is keeping Mr Mahogany informed of developments, and he in turn is working to stabilise the island -- leaving me to work on the landscaping. While I was busy adjusting the levels, who should turn up but Quin!

He was looking far more relaxed than he has been over the past year. He too expressed pleasure at seeing the old carriage house once more.

He swiftly moved on to other matters, particularly emphasising the idea of developing "homes-from-home" across the various worlds. 


23 Dec 2010
I visited Shell 415 today -- excellent progress has been made. My apartment is virtually finished, with a comfortable sitting area and kitchenette, and a small office area. A crate full of books is ready to be unpacked and added to the bookshelves.

What is really exciting is the bespoke linking book delivery mechanism ametist and D'Lanor have designed and implemented. The linking books are stored in a secure basement area underneath my apartment, and accessed by typing in a code on the keypad outside the bookroom (which is normally locked) in the corner of my apartment.

I was so taken with what D'Lanor and ametist have produced that I fetched Quin over to try it for himself. There are two books installed on the system at the moment: for Neolbah and Serene. I typed in the temporary code for Serene, then we both used the book that appeared.

Quin was rather taken aback by what he saw when he first linked in to Serene: "I didn't Write THAT into Serene."

I was unsympathetic, I'm afraid: "Well, now you know why Andy got mad at you. Altering another's Descriptive Book can have unforeseen consequences..."


26 Dec 2010
Over the holiday period, I spent some time in the spheres' source world. Quin took me to the new location of Waysmeet and Deepwater. The view of the two islands from his lab and workshop is wonderful!

To my surprise, there has appeared a chain of islands to the south of Quin's base island. I asked him about them.

"They appeared a week or so ago," he replied. "They are remarkably similar to those that were to the east of our old location. I hope the spheres I was trying to use to bring the islands here didn't inadvertantly pick those others up as well. If so, I might have some explaining to do to their owner..."


30 Dec 2010
The Security Ombudsman inspected Shell 415 today. Ametist translated his report for the rest of us. He noted that the issues from the first report have been fixed. The inspection of plumbing and electricity in apartment 1 went well, and he had no remarks. 

So we've the green light to continue!


31 Dec 2010
Having woken early this morning, I decided to link in to the spheres' source world to check on things there.

All seems well in Waysmeet and Deepwater -- but to the west there is yet another new island. Is this a further unintended consequence of Quin's work? Or is something else going on?

=====
Later in the day:
For some time I've thought that there are simply too few of us working with the Devokan Trust to have any hope of making sense of what is happening. Accordingly, I have been in contact with Shenn and Leah, the talented individuals who were behind the development of the Lost Pages sphere on the old Devokan, the Bone Cage and the remarkable world of Tao (among other things).

It was Leah who originally came up with the idea of the "Lost Pages" mechanical sphere, to encapsulate elements of what might have been on those pages burned by Atrus's sons so long ago in the Myst library. There are obvious parallels here with the work of the Devokan Trust.

I am very pleased to say that both have agreed to share their expertise and knowledge with the Devokan Trust as consultants. They have accordingly travelled across to the spheres' source world, and have already started work there.

<p align=left>2 Jan 2011
On my return to Winterfell, another letter was waiting for me from Elspeth Sorrelwood:

=================
My dear Ms Macchi

As you have noticed, a new island has appeared to the west of Waysmeet and Deepwater. I have just visited there myself -- and to my surprise it appears to be a place I remember very well indeed.

It is embarrassing for me, as a Sister of Time, to have to admit that my plans have been overtaken by events, but that is what has happened.

For the "new" island was my home for many years, until the time I "retired" to Devokan and subsequently entered into my last period of Renewal.

During those years, I studied the island in detail: its geology, geography, flora and fauna -- the details I faithfully recorded in my journals.

On my visit today, I saw my old greenhouse; the observation tower too; various experiments across the island; my ship; the pod homes of the island's original inhabitants, and the building they put up at my own suggestion.

Your suggestion that one of Quinquifid's experiments might be behind this rings true. Here, however, it has operated not only across spatial dimensions, but also captured an instance of remembered time itself...

In closing, I should mention the name of the island: it was Skysong, for it was my home.

4 Jan 2011
I linked across to Quin's workshop on Touchstone (he has renamed his island since Shenn and Leah, the creators of the Lost Pages sphere, are now working in the world of Restoration).

I brought Elspeth Sorrelwood's letter with me, thinking it might interest Quin. As he read it, to my surprise, he started looking uncomfortable.

"What's the matter?" I asked.

"I have committed a grave error in my science. Basic experimental procedures spell out the importance of varying only one factor at a time. I could understand the islands to the south being caught up with experiments in this world. But this letter -- with its clear reference to Skysong -- might it be connected with the Devokan sphere I placed in Serene? I have no way of telling."


9 Jan 2011
Since the opening to the public of Phase 3 of Shell 415 in Ahra Pahts earlier this week, there has been a noticeable emptying of fridge and foodstore in my apartment. First all the beer went, then the Earl Grey tea, then ...

Perhaps the next development phase of the shell needs to include an honesty box!


15 Jan 2011
A quiet week for once, working behind the scenes. 

First, Quin has been popping in and out of Shell 415; he is none too pleased about the Serene linking book being locked away, especially since the clue for the final keypad combination he needs is not from his own cultural background (perhaps that was mean of me, but I did want to prevent further outbursts from Andy).

As we have worked together on Shell 415, ametist and I have had several long conversations about the Devokan Trust -- its aims, and current and planned projects. Quin joined in with one or two (much to our surprise -- he normally keeps himself to himself). What was even more surprising was that he asked if ametist would consider working for the Trust as an independent freelance, much as I do. She said "Yes!"


17 Jan 2011
One of the ideas that came out of the discussions between ametist, Quin and myself was the need for a central place where we could plan and document the various projects we undertake for the Devokan Trust and as independent freelances.

I'm pleased to say that we now have that area: the Devokan Trust forum, at http://forum.devokan.org/.

This is not just for Trust matters, but for anyone working to "research and restore what was lost". 

As Quin put it: "Think of the lost, burnt pages of the books in the original Myst library. What worlds and wonders were lost as a result? Are we beginning to find them, as we build in the D'ni way, or experiment in other worlds?"

I'm excited by what we might discover as we work together across worlds...


25 Jan 2011
It's coming up to a year since the original Devokan was burned up by its sun, and still the nature of the orbs that seemed to "rescue" elements of it exercises the minds of those involved -- and new friends too.

Over on the Devokan Trust forum, a thread that started simply to record their appearance has developed into a discussion of various experiments to capture and control them, with contributions from Quin, Nal, Filbert, ametist and Mat.

Then a new explorer, Zenoc, has recorded his own thoughts on this intriguing phenomenon in his journal, along with discoveries he made using restoration links.

For the new forum is not just about the Devokan regions. There are other stories and journals to discover, for example about ametist's Moysenland, and Kemy's and Zuri's explorations and Ages.


28 Jan 2011
Once again, the world of Restoration is inaccessible. It must have started sometime on Thursday evening. Both Mat and Shenn seem to be OK. Mat sent me a message me yesterday evening, and Shenn even came across to the Inn in Winterfell Reverie. However, I've yet not heard from Paislee -- I hope she is OK.

Quin, it seems, was not in Touchstone when the communications and linking blackout fell this time. I gather he is camping in his half-finished apartment in Shell 415. 

I suppose I had better check supplies in Shell 415 -- again ...


<pb><p align=center>=== FEBRUARY ===

<p align=left>1 Feb 2011
I needn't have worried about Paislee. She sent me a note while I was in Winterfell Reverie, and over the weekend we spent a happy time together putting the world to rights, as well as working on the land there.

Quin too turned up, lodging in the Flyer in the sky above, while starting up some fresh experiments.

I think we all were worried about the length of time that Restoration was inaccessible. Fortunately, communication was finally restored earlier today. I have just returned from checking the various islands around Waysmeet and all seems well.


2 Feb 2011
With the anniversary of the loss of the original Devokan's world fast approaching, I've been looking over some of the photos I took of the farewell celebration on 7 February 2010 and finally posted them to my account on Flickr (I'm Dot Macchi there).

I'd forgotten how one of the orbs hovered over the standing stones that mysteriously (re)appeared during the original Devokan's last week or so. 

Having recently visited the Lost Stonehenge -- an Uru age discovered by Karkadann -- I am beginning to wonder what "coincidences" might be at work here. Accordingly I contacted Quin, suggesting that he might check it out.


4 Feb 2011
Quin suggested that I might ask Karkadann for more background information about the Lost Stonehenge. Here's Karkadann's reply:
=====
The Lost Stonehenge -- was it was some form of Ancient Tardis that was somehow torn out of our known reality and stored in deep space so that it would not fall into the wrong hands?

Perhaps it was recently rediscovered by The Doctor, who was just curious about what the older versions of the Tardis looked like.

Who would have thought it was sitting under our noses in England all this time?
=====

An early Tardis? Was that why it appeared in our lost world just days before the original Devokan's destruction? And why was the orb hovering over it?

What exactly did we lose with the loss of Devokan? And what more have we gained with its loss?

Something deep is going on here. 


16 Feb 2011
Ametist and I were sitting in my apartment in Shell 415, enjoying a cup of coffee together and putting the world to rights, when I heard the doors of Quin's apartment slide open. Since there were various things I needed to discuss with Quin, I asked ametist to excuse me and walked across the courtyard.

Quin was on edge. He had just been to Tallis, Mr Mahogany's island, he told me, in response to a letter from him that had been delayed by over a week.

He showed me some of the photos he took.

Quin sighed: "I am not sure what I can do in these circumstances other than to monitor developments. As it is I am neglecting my own work both in Tao and in Shell 415---"

I almost felt guilty when I told him what else needed his attention... 


20 Feb 2011
Well, that little comment has come back and bitten me! I was enjoying a lazy day over in the Devokan Trust's land in Winterfell Reverie, when Quin linked in and started to berate me in that tight-lipped way of his.

The problem as I see it is that he has never learned to delegate -- he assumes all the work himself, whether from the belief that no one else CAN do it, or whether from the inability to understand others' willingness or even desire to take on such responsibility.

I tried to calm him down, to get him to list the matters he was concerned about, to work out ways to take some of the pressures from him. I pointed out the abilities and skills of ametist and D'Lanor, suggesting that they might be able to implement some of his planned experiments for Shell 415.

Quin's biggest concern seemed to be about the Celestial Clock, being able to install it somewhere in Winterfell Reverie where it would be safe and correctly perform its regulatory function. Apparently the Clock is mentioned many times in his aunt's journals, and I too remembered her injunction to find it as a matter of urgency (events got a bit in the way of that).

So we brainstormed possibilities for a while -- a good ploy, in fact, for Quin's mood lifts considerably when he plays with ideas. In this case, though, I came up with the option we eventually settled on: to re-use and adapt a wonderful structure re-created by Uru explorer Dialyser Sommer during the last exile from the Cavern.

I contacted Dialyser straight away, explained what we needed to do, and he agreed!


25 Feb 2011
While I was working in Winterfell Reverie today, finally getting the Time Vault installed deep under the river bed, I received a rather enigmatic note from Shenn: "Time spheres are dancing in Tao Lia sky".

Intrigued, I linked across to Tao Lia on Restoration. What I found there astounded me. I went back to Shell 415 to fetch Quin -- I knew he would be fascinated.

Time spheres, yes -- through their graceful, gentle dance, they somehow slow time down.


<pb><p align=center>=== MARCH ===

<p align=left>3 Mar 2011
Quin is obviously worried by what is happening in Tallis. He came over to Devokan Dusklight in Winterfell today to discuss the situation. 

While the orbs in Tallis have affected some of the regions close by -- such as Filbert's Tannhauser Gate -- they seem not to have caused problems in the other regions round Waysmeet, or on Shenn's Tao regions. 

I wondered whether we should invite Shenn to set up in Devokan Dusklight an experiment that might tap into the Tao time spheres. Quin agreed. 

I then went on to show him the Time Vault, and the Celestial Clock. The Vault will need further work, but at least it is in place. 

Quin took the opportunity to update the portal system for the area.


8 Mar 2011
Shenn has installed what he called a Time Vortex in the skies above Devokan Dusklight. The effect is strangely beautiful. The experiment is hidden within a structure looking a little like a second moon.]]></translation>

<p align=left>December 9
I am most grateful to Mr Whitfield for the chance to stay once more in his comfortable guest rooms. The past two weeks have required strenuous mental and physical effort on my part -- to say nothing of having to deal with a strong emotional response to the misinterpretation of my earlier actions.

So here I am, sitting at the desk in the cosy upstairs study, fire blazing in the hearth, myself pondering how to respond to my critics, and typing out my thoughts on the most-excellent Steambook Pro (whose price, I note, has gone down since I bought mine -- c'est la vie).

I have come to the conclusion, after all that I have gained and lost over the past eighteen months, that no world can be regarded as sufficiently stable to be regarded as 'home', not when all can be lost in less than a month, with so little warning.

Rather, what is required is to duplicate what one can across several worlds -- hence my experiment in Serene, in bringing elements from the spheres' world into the Uru universe. Yes, it destroyed the old Serene, but surely the achievement of melding two previously separate worlds should be celebrated, not condemned.

Instability continues in the spheres' source world. It is that which I have been working with over the past days and weeks. I have successfully caused the islands of Deepwater and Waysmeet to be transported to a new place on that world's map. I also took the opportunity of merging my base in that world, the Lost Pages region, with the transported islands.

It gives me great satisfaction to stand at the window of my laboratory and look across to the tree village and the tranquil island of Deepwater, knowing that, having once more been able to move them out of harm's way, I can repeat the action should the need arise. Hope is slowly returning...

There is still much to be done. I have not been in touch with Miss Paislee or Ms Dot since the incident with Serene. The duplication of elements across the worlds is vital -- I must talk with them how this might be achieved, even in Winterfell. 


December 13
The days pass pleasantly in studying, thinking, walking... A most welcome respite.

Mr Whitfield graciously entertained me in his drawing room, where we whiled away an hour in civilised conversation, as men of science are apt to do. It seems that we have been pondering similar mysteries, albeit from slightly different angles.

I finally found Ms Dot up in Winterfell Reverie. Because of her concern about the continuing instability in the other world, she has acquired land there, intending to make a home-from-home for Miss Paislee and herself. It was wonderful to see the old carriage house once again -- it brought back happy memories of times spent in the original Devokan Inn, especially of eating Miss Paislee's delicious home-made soup during the winter months, warming myself before the fire.

I attempted to reassure her about happenings in that other world -- that Waysmeet and Deepwater were safe, and that my own island had an outlook over both. 

I can understand Ms Dot's concern, though. It is strange how we are all adopting a similar course of action: that of setting up homes-from-home in each world, so that no matter what transpires, we still have a refuge somewhere.


December 14
Today I returned to my base on Lost Pages, only to find that a chain of islands have appeared to the south. The land formation of one named Nuevo Relto is fascinating -- and it shows signs of being recently inhabited. There is no one there at present. 


December 24
Another island has appeared -- this is to the west of Waysmeet. It too has signs of past occupation. I am becoming a little concerned.


December 31
It is now nearly a year since I and the warrior Nalates made our historic journey tracing the source world of the strange spheres. Yet in all this time, in spite of naming islands and areas in the world, we have not come up with a name for the world itself.

So yesterday, Ms Dot, Miss Paislee and I met up in my workshop overlooking the same(?) tree village that the spheres transported, and had a brainstorming session on possible names.

Miss Paislee came up with the name we finally settled on: Restoration. It chimes nicely with the aims of the Devokan Trust.


<pb><p align=center>:::  JANUARY 2011 :::

<p align=left>January 5
Yesterday Ms Dot showed me another letter supposedly from my "late aunt". Details in it match the layout of the new island. Similarly, equipment on the new island matches that found by Miss Paislee in the tower on Curiosity.

The letter also refers to journal entries: these I checked in my aunt's journals, and they tally. 

So it seems that the new island is Skysong, and from an earlier time. But how? Was it the sphere in Serene?


January 17
Today I removed a crystal engine from one of the small sailboats we found in Waysmeet. Interesting construction. I hope to get it working again.


January 19
This small engine appears to use a power source similar to that of the larger mechanism whose bits we found near the Tower on Curiosity in July/August last year, after the landslip that revealed the ancient crystal mine.

I reassembled the larger engine near my lab on Touchstone some time ago, keeping it outside (just in case). While that seems to be a static engine (as far as I can tell), this smaller one is obviously designed for mobile use, being far lighter.


January 21
I'm making good progress with the smaller engine and will try reinstalling it in the small boat.

Ms Dot dropped by while I was working. She mentioned Mr Holmer's experiments on the Devokan orbs. Apparently he too is using electromagnetic methods of containment and control.

She also mentioned work undertaken by Ms Nalates, which appears to confirm that the orbs do operate across time as well as space (something suggested by the unexpected arrival of my aunt Elspeth's former island home next to Waysmeet).

However, I've no time to look into this at the moment. Best to complete the boat engine, then see what else has been discovered.


January 26
I am still a little irritated with myself over that lapse in experimental procedure with regard to innvestigating the spheres' nature and actions. In fact, I am minded to move to observation rather than active experimentation. It seems that Ms Nalates and Mr Filbert have parallel experiments underway, so such a change in focus on my part would seem appropriate.

A day or so ago, I linked to Tao, the area M Shenn and Mlle Leah are working on in Restoration. M Shenn was there, and Miss Paislee arrived soon after. The ensuing conversation suggested the next step that I should take. 

M Shenn is a philosopher. I quote below his words about Tao:
======
time is not stable here ...
maybe spheres are dancing in time or maybe singing
i do feel they are souls sometimes
Tao is a strange age ...
beauty can be strange ... 
we can't understand at all ... 
we are open minds ... but mind can't feel all ... 
there are some ways outside of mind
=====

M Shenn has kindly set up one of the age's small homes, which are suspended in the central tree's flying roots, for my own use. The plan is to observe the instabilities M Shenn mentioned. It might offer some clues as to the unexpected reappearance of my aunt's previous home island of Skysong from the past.


January 29
Just two days after writing my last entry, the world of Restoration became inaccessible once more. I fire up the transporter, but it stops abruptly in the middle of its startup cycle.

I have spent some time in Ahra Pahts, investigating Prin Pahts in particular. Through my trusty geological hammer I was able to obtain samples of the different crystals there, carefully removing them from places that I don't think will be noticed. These samples I have taken up to my apartment in Shell 415 for later analysis.

The apartment is taking shape: the door and walls are finished and some furniture has been delivered already. It is good that Dot's apartment across the courtyard has tea, coffee and biscuits. I have raided those more than once over the last few days.


<pb><p align=center>:::  FEBRUARY  :::

<p align=left>February 1
Mr Zenoc asked on the Trust's forums about the crystals in Prin Pahts, being curious as to what makes them glow. 

I responded that whatever it is, it is not inherent to the crystal itself. The crystal samples in my apartment are dull-looking; i.e. reflective of light and translucent, but not glowing.

Within Prin Pahts, they may be operating as a conduit for an external source of power, but this is only speculation on my part.

I suggested asking Mr Aloys and Mr RtR, given their extensive work in restoring the city.


February 2
Ms Dot contacted me yesterday evening, suggesting that I needed to check out Mr Karkadann's Lost Stonehenge. She was most insistent. When I asked, "Why?" she merely replied, "You will see when you get there."

====
A most interesting day, linking to the Lost Stonehenge. For once, Ms Dot's insistence was not misplaced. I have seen the artefact at the end of what might be called the Avenue Island at least once before, and that was recently in the wood near Devokan Dusklight in Winterfell Reverie -- it looked most out of place in that medieval realm. However, it disappeared overnight, along with the wood's inhabitants; Time Lords, they called themselves.

This put me in mind of a passage in one of my aunt's journals. She too had come across these Time Lords (it seems she belongs to a parallel organisation, the Sisterhood of Time).

It is strange how often my attention has been forced upon Time in recent weeks. First, my aunt's stricture to Ms Dot to install a "Celestial Clock" mechanism; then Ms Nalates' experiments with the Devokan orbs to reach back in time to facilitate the transfer of an ancient D'ni building to her North Restoration; then the unexpected appearance of my aunt's old home of Skysong; and most recently M. Shenn's enigmatic utterances about Tao.

I wonder if Mr Karkadann could shed more light on the background to the Lost Stonehenge. Perhaps Ms Dot might ask him...


February 14
I went away for a few days as the anniversary of the destruction of Devokan's home world approached. While the pain of that loss has eased, it still has power to suddenly disrupt thought.

But the anniversary came and went without incident.

I am back at work now, setting up an experiment in the third area of Shell 415. I am excited by what might be possible using a combination of the crystals from Prin Pahts and those I have brought across from the ancient mines we have found on Touchstone in Restoration.

The crystals each have a distinctive "hum". I've worked out a way to "tune" them (one of Sir Isaac Newton's original ideas proved enlightening), but need to rig up a control panel.


February 16
I have just received a rather worrying note from Mr Mahogany, dated 7 February. Quite what caused the delay in delivery, I do not know.

Be that as it may, its contents worried me sufficiently to leave the work in Shell 415, return to Touchstone to pick up some portable monitoring equipment and my camera, and link directly to Tallis, Mr Mahogany's home.

He says he has released a very powerful orb in Tallis. Has he gone mad? He saw what the orbs were capable of last year with the destruction of Devokan Touchstone and Devokan Skysong (I know that good eventually came from destruction, but that is beside the point).

It seems he is planning to use the orb to somehow propel himself back in time -- all in the name of trying to find his brother.

When I reached Tallis, I could see that his plans were well underway.


February 18
I am working around the clock. While I am confident that the equipment now installed in Shell 415 will do the job, there are still gaps in the theory motivating the experiment.

However, I suspect that an odd-looking diagram I spotted in one of my aunt's journals might close one of those gaps. Ms Dot provided the clue to its interpretation yesterday -- one set of symbols are for colours (she recognised them as from "Riven"); the others I could easily read as D'ni numerals. 

At the same time, I am acutely aware of all the other tasks urgently demanding my attention. 


February 20
This is intolerable. Just one week back from a few days away and I am already under intense pressure. Time to confront Ms Dot.


February 21
That meeting went far better than I had expected.

After an hour or so linking from world to age to world, I finally tracked Ms Dot down in Winterfell Reverie. She was studying strategies in En Garde, a fencing method that seems to be popular in that medieval realm.

To be honest, when I saw that, my ire rose. That she has time for such frivolities...

I kept my voice very level, very deliberate, as I enumerated the tasks the Trust must accomplish, and the enormous responsibility and impossible pressure that it places on my shoulders. Ms Dot listened without interruption, not even anticipating what I was going to say (another habit of hers that I find exceedingly irritating).

When I had finished, she said: "You must delegate, Quin. There is too much going in too many worlds on for one person to have an oversight of it all. Let's see what might be possible."

For an hour and a half we brainstormed, trying to set priorities, seeing where other individuals' contributions might help. Finally, there was a clear plan for the next few weeks.

Ms Dot is going to focus on Trust activities in Winterfell Reverie. As a matter of priority, she will set up a "Time Vault", a safe place for the Celestial Clock she has tracked down. I pressed upon her the importance of the clock as suggested by its frequent mention in my aunt's journal ("Sisterhood of Time"? What is the connection?).

Being released from these concerns means that I can focus on events in Restoration -- the intriguing developments in Tao, for example, and the rather more alarming events on Tallis -- and on the final tweaks to the experiment in Shell 415.

When the meeting was over, I linked back to Tallis, just to check. At that time, the containment mechanism was still holding, but it was obvious that the orb's power was increasing. It is only a matter of time.

I shook my head in dismay at what Mr Mahogany has set in motion, and linked back to Touchstone and then to Shell 415.


February 25
Normally I find Ms Dot's interruptions an irritation, but what she had to show me today could well be significant, especially given events in Tallis. 

The spheres discovered by M. Shenn in Tao Lia do indeed slow time. I do not understand how.


February 26
The Trust Logbook says it all. I am extremely relieved -- and surprised too. A most unexpected link. 

<pb><p align=center>:::  MARCH  :::

<p align=left>March 1
The situation in Tallis is worsening. The main sphere has spawned two minor orbs, each of which is nearly free of the containment mechanism.

The house close by has started to collapse.

The power emanating from the orbs is palpable.

I note that Mr Mahogany has moved the vehicle to the lee of a hill. Sensible, but...

I do wish he had not set this process into motion in the first place. I am extremely worried about the possible consequences.


March 3
Good discussion in Winterfell with Ms Dot. She will contact M Shenn to set up a small-scale experiment in the skies above Devokan Dusklight.


March 7
Work in other areas has kept me away from Tallis. But today I revisited to check developments.

The orbs' power is increasing. It still seems to be spawning minor orbs, two at a time. Some of these have escaped their confinement.

Fires have completely consumed one of the trees; others are now burning in the interior of the nearby house, which has suffered further depredation.

I also saw two orbs partially submerged in the river that flows through the centre of the island -- a new development. The furthest one was beneath one of the arches of the main bridge across the river; the other was at a bend in the river.

The plan Mr Mahogany mentioned in his diary, of "pushing" the neighbouring island of Pangaea away using giant rams, seems to have succeeded. There was no sign of the island, and on that side of Tallis there were signs of landslip.]]></translation>

The Testimony of
Gordon Ulysses Smith



<pb>

<pb><font size=12 face=Courier color=221166><p align=left>My name is Gordon Ulysses Smith but I've gone by the moniker Guss since school days. At age 17 I joined the military as a medic and was thrown into a war zone. I don't talk too much about this I find it eases the flashbacks.

In a response to issues around PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) I was transferred away from combat situations and joined the investigation branch of the Military Police.

Since then I have specialised in forensic archaeology, including a specialist placement with Dr Grissom, a renowned forensic entomologist.

On leaving the military I have been working as an independent investigator and was recruited by what I thought was the 'The Writers Guild'. I have since found out that I am working for 'The Guild of Writers' -- a subtle but important difference.

In order to preserve my independence I was guided to a spot in the New Mexican desert where the only clue to my investigative direction was the word 'ink'.

I suppose it's pointless going into the detail of my first encounter with Yeesha and the ages of the D'ni. From talking with other explorers my experience with that encounter seems to be broadly similar to all others who have walked this path.

In an effort to preserve my objectivity I avoided contact with the DRC during their tenure of the cavern -- although as an archaeologist I have been appalled by some of their methods, particularly in their search for rich sponsors and the hoarding of artefacts.

Other explorers, to give them their own title, have found ways into areas blocked by barriers and some kind of force generator. I believe these force fields (for the want of a better name) have some link to artefacts acquired by the DRC.

The misuse and recently lack of maintenance has resulted in some strange effects like invisible floors and the ability to jump places you just should not be able to reach.

There seems to be some sort of interaction with the KI device that enables a wearer to drop distances that would normally prove an ankle-breaker.

I can't help wondering if the DRC have been using explorers as guinea pigs for this technology in the hope of developing some military application they could sell on for some significant sum.

One thing I did note on my exploration of the cavern following the path set out by Yeesha was the body in the vault in the Kadish age. I did think it strange that the DRC had not removed the body for investigation -- only to find it was physically fused to the floor of the vault.

I carried out a preliminary investigation and am of the opinion he (and he is male by all our norms) did not die by his own hand. I also concluded that he has been there an undetermined time in excess of one hundred and fifty years -- probably longer given the conditions in the vault.

I did wonder why the DRC had not removed the gold till I discovered that the same cause that appeared to fuse the body to the floor had fused the coins together and also fused them to the floor of the vault.

Consider the following speculation, but I wonder... Could the same device that powers the force-field effects in the city be at work in the vault, simply preventing contact with those elements the DRC and others would seek to remove?

If word of this were to get to the military this place would be shut down tighter than Groom Lake.

Given that the only group we know of with freedom of movement was the DRC, and we are told they are not active in the cavern, then who or what is operating the boat you can occasionally see from Bevin? "Something is Rotten in the State of Denmark" to quote Shakespeare.

Speaking of things strange, I was looking at the damage at the entry to the Kahlo pub. I found some residue on some of the fragments. I managed to get a scraping and found reasonably fresh traces of C4, which seems totally incompatible not only with the D'ni but also incompatible with an organisation whose stated aim is reconstruction.

Either the DRC have been using methods of a non-archaeological nature or there is some other group playing here.

Also the DRC did an organised withdrawal. How come they left 26 translations of the Kings books in the Hall of Kings? We have only the DRC word that they are accurate. And what about those books up on the Tokotah rooftop? I think they thought that was a secure location.

Last week I finally got round to my original objective: ink. I was given a hint that it's something to do with beetles; hence the Guild interest in my past. I was on the Gahreesen age when I found those cabinet things with a beetle motif. I took samples from the cabinet that was partially open and I've been examining them for about three weeks now. They are unlike anything I've seen before.

Bear in mind all I have are fragments. The wing cases are a golden colour; curvature would make them similar in shape to a ladybird. They are insects, but I had one complete pupa that had been dead for some time. I was able to extract some material but its DNA was incompatible with Earth fauna.

I have kept the sequence. It does follow standard DNA chemistry in that it consists of deoxyribose plus two pyrimidines cytosine and thymine and two purines guanine and adenine as base pairs. The sequence can be expressed as a sequence of the letters C, T, G and A. Though it follows no sequence of any insect genome I can find, I have set out to find a sample of ink preferably in a wet state so I can run it through an HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) column. I may get to a position where I may be able to synthesize it.

The ink appears common to all linking processes; this includes cloths. I got a sample from that torn one on Tokotah roof. From descriptions of the Bahro -- I have not actually seen one close to -- I think they may be insectivorous, giving them access to the insect-derived chemical. Their continued existence and ability to link wherever and whenever they wish would suggest they still have access to the insects in some age yet undiscovered.

It would also suggest that paper is not the only medium or that we may get away with paper of any type.

I managed to find a sample chipping that appeared to be this mythical D'ni miracle substance, Nara. The structure was fascinating: a crystalline ceramic formed under stellar pressures with carbon nanotube strutting inbuilt at the crystalline level.

I propose that the pressures were achieved using the force fields I mentioned earlier, enabling moulds of pure energy. It also looks like the D'ni were able to form slabs of this on a huge scale and then cut it into blocks using linking technology. The stress and fracture lines along cut edges are commensurate with some sort of shearing action.

There's another form, where walls and structures are made from materials other than Nara moulded as shells of phenomenal thinness and extreme strength held under tension like the skin on a drum. Some of these surfaces show phase instability and you will appear to partially pass through the surface. This is actually an optical illusion caused by surface refraction.

I am positive the DRC has access to all this information. As soon as I can I will release the formula for ink to the Guild and new books should start appearing in the cavern.]]></translation></element>
